An Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is used for decoupling applications. It is a message queue on which you place messages for processing by application components. In this case you can process each data processing part in separate ECS tasks and have them write an Amazon SQS queue. That way the backend can pick up the messages from the queue when they’re ready and there is no delay due to the second part not being complete.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Process each part using a separate ECS task. Create an Amazon SQS queue\" is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Process both parts using the same ECS task. Create an Amazon Kinesis Firehose stream\" is incorrect. Amazon Kinesis Firehose is used for streaming data. This is not an example of streaming data. In this case SQS is better as a message can be placed on a queue to indicate that the job is complete and ready to be picked up by the backend application component.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Process each part using a separate ECS task. Create an Amazon SNS topic and send a notification when the processing completes\" is incorrect. Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) can be used for sending notifications. It is useful when you need to notify multiple AWS services. In this case an Amazon SQS queue is a better solution as there is no mention of multiple AWS services and this is an ideal use case for SQS.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create an Amazon DynamoDB table and save the output of the first part to the table\" is incorrect. Amazon DynamoDB is unlikely to be a good solution for this requirement. There is a limit on the maximum amount of data that you can store in an entry in a DynamoDB table.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architect-associate/application-integration/amazon-sqs/\">https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-solutions-architect-associate/application-integration/amazon-sqs/</a></p><p><strong>Save time with our AWS cheat sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/aws-application-integration-services/\">https://digitalcloud.training/aws-application-integration-services/</a></p>",

To do this you can create a custom CloudWatch metric that measures the number of messages in the queue and then configure the ASG to scale using a target tracking policy that tracks a certain value.</p><p><strong>CORRECT: </strong>\"Create an Amazon SQS queue and custom CloudWatch metric to measure the number of messages in the queue. Configure the ASG to scale based on the number of messages in the queue\" is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create an Amazon SNS Topic to generate a notification each time a message is uploaded. Have the ASG scale based on the number of SNS messages\" is incorrect. The Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is used for sending notifications using topics. Amazon SQS is a better solution for this scenario as it provides a decoupling mechanism where the actual images can be stored for processing. SNS does not provide somewhere for the images to be stored.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create a target tracking policy that keeps the ASG at 70% CPU utilization\" is incorrect. Using a target tracking policy with the ASG that tracks CPU utilization does not allow scaling based on the number of images being uploaded.</p><p><strong>INCORRECT:</strong> \"Create a scheduled policy that scales the ASG at times of expected peak load\" is incorrect. Using a scheduled policy is less dynamic as though you may be able to predict usage patterns, it would be better to adjust dynamically based on actual usage.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html</a></p><p><strong>Save time with our AWS cheat sheets:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://digitalcloud.training/amazon-ec2-auto-scaling/\">https://digitalcloud.training/amazon-ec2-auto-scaling/</a></p>",
