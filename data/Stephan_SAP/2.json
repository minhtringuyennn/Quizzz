With SAML, you can enable a single sign-on experience for your users across many SAML-enabled applications and services. Users authenticate with the IdP once using a single set of credentials, and then get access to multiple applications and services without additional sign-ins.</p>\n\n<p>For the given scenario, the company wants to control access to on-premises as well as AWS Cloud resources (specifically via the AWS Management Console) using Active Directory, so it should use SAML 2.0 federated users to access the AWS Management Console. You also create an IAM role with a trust policy that sets the SAML provider as the principal, which establishes a trust relationship between your organization and AWS. The role's permission policy establishes what users from your organization are allowed to do in AWS. In this case, the role will have a PowerUserAccess managed policy attached. As the PowerUserAccess managed policy will allow the developers to create RDS instances in any Region, therefore, you also need to attach a customer-managed policy that denies access to RDS in any AWS Region except us-east-1.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt1-q2-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html</a></p>\n\n<p>At a high-level, it is useful to think of these access privileges in the form of this equation:</p>\n\n<p>PowerUserAccess = AdministrativeAccess - IAM</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure SAML-based authentication tied to an IAM role that has the AdministrativeAccess managed policy attached to it.

When you batch 10 messages per operation (maximum), FIFO queues can support up to 3,000 (<code>300*10</code>) messages per second.

Customers can request a dedicated connection through the AWS Direct Connect console, the CLI, or the API. This supports speed of 1Gbps and 10Gbps.</p>\n\n<p>Hosted Connection: A physical Ethernet connection that an AWS Direct Connect Partner provisions on behalf of a customer. Customers request a hosted connection by contacting a partner in the AWS Direct Connect Partner Program, who provisions the connection.

Amazon EC2 instances can access your file system across AZs, Regions, and VPCs, while on-premises servers can access using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN. You can connect to Amazon EFS file systems from EC2 instances in other AWS Regions using an inter-Region VPC peering connection, and from on-premises servers using an AWS VPN connection. EFS is also POSIX compliant and can be shared across many systems, so it fits the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/r2018/b/EFS/product-page-diagram-Amazon-EFS-Launch_How-It-Works.cf947858f0ef3557b9fc14077bdf3f65b3f9ff43.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/efs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/efs/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Use EC2 Instance Store as the service tier of the storage layer</strong></p>\n\n<p>An instance store (also known as ephemeral storage) provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost.</p>\n\n<p>As Instance Store based volumes provide high random I/O performance at low cost (as the storage is part of the instance's usage cost) and the fault-tolerant architecture can adjust for the loss of any instance, therefore you should use Instance Store based EC2 instances for this use-case.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 Instance Store Overview:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt1-q10-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Per the given use-case, the key requirement for the service tier of the storage layer is to support block storage with more than a million IOPS. The Max IOPS per volume supported by EBS is only 256K for provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 block express).

SQS offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components. SQS locks your messages during processing, so that multiple producers can send and multiple consumers can receive messages at the same time. Using the right combination of delay queues and visibility timeout, you can optimize the solution to address use-cases where the consumer application needs additional time to process messages such as the one in this scenario. Messages are put into the SQS queue via a Lambda function that is triggered when a new video file is uploaded to S3 for processing.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt1-q11-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-delay-queues.html</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt1-q11-i2.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html</a></p>\n\n<p>To ensure that the consumer applications running on the video processing instances can scale via an Auto Scaling group, you could use the SQS queue depth (known as the CloudWatch Amazon SQS metric - ApproximateNumberOfMessages) as the underlying metric. However, the issue with using a CloudWatch Amazon SQS metric like ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible for target tracking is that the number of messages in the queue might not change proportionally to the size of the Auto Scaling group that processes messages from the queue. An optimized solution would be to use a backlog per instance metric with the target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt1-q11-i3.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Refactor the application to run from Amazon S3 instead of the EFS file system and upload the video files directly to an S3 bucket via an API Gateway based REST API.

Deploy the application on Amazon EC2 instances configured behind an Auto Scaling Group</strong> - To meet your connectivity and workload requirements, Aurora Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts the number of Aurora Replicas provisioned for an Aurora DB cluster using single-master replication. Aurora Auto Scaling enables your Aurora DB cluster to handle sudden increases in connectivity or workload. When the connectivity or workload decreases, Aurora Auto Scaling removes unnecessary Aurora Replicas so that you don't pay for unused provisioned DB instances.</p>\n\n<p>You define and apply a scaling policy to an Aurora DB cluster. The scaling policy defines the minimum and maximum number of Aurora Replicas that Aurora Auto Scaling can manage. Based on the policy, Aurora Auto Scaling adjusts the number of Aurora Replicas up or down in response to actual workloads, determined by using Amazon CloudWatch metrics and target values.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer with Round Robin routing algorithm and sticky sessions enabled</strong> - Your load balancer serves as a single point of contact for clients and distributes incoming traffic across its healthy registered targets. You can register each target with one or more target groups.</p>\n\n<p>By default, the round-robin routing algorithm is used to route requests at the target group level. Round robin is a good choice when the requests and targets are similar, or if you need to distribute requests equally among targets.</p>\n\n<p>By default, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) routes each request independently to a registered target based on the chosen load-balancing algorithm. However, you can use the sticky session feature (also known as session affinity) to enable the load balancer to bind a user's session to a specific target. This ensures that all requests from the user during the session are sent to the same target. This feature is useful for servers that maintain state information to provide a continuous experience to clients. To use sticky sessions, the client must support cookies.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable Aurora Auto Scaling for Aurora Writes. Deploy the application on Amazon EC2 instances configured behind an Auto Scaling Group</strong> - Aurora Auto Scaling is possible for Aurora replicas and not for Aurora writer instances. Multi-master Aurora Cluster architecture is needed if multiple writers are needed for any use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer with flow hash routing algorithm and sticky sessions enabled</strong> - The flow hash routing algorithm can only be used with Network Load Balancers. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer with Least Outstanding Requests routing algorithm and sticky sessions enabled</strong> - This statement is incorrect. Network Load Balancer does not support Least Outstanding Requests routing algorithm. AWS suggests using the Least Outstanding Requests with an ALB when the requests for your application vary in complexity or your targets vary in processing capability.</p>\n\n<p>For TCP traffic, the Network Load Balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and TCP sequence number. The TCP connections from a client have different source ports and sequence numbers and can be routed to different targets. Each TCP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection.</p>\n\n<p>For UDP traffic, the Network Load Balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. A UDP flow has the same source and destination, so it is consistently routed to a single target throughout its lifetime. Different UDP flows have different source IP addresses and ports, so they can be routed to different targets.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html#modify-routing-algorithm\">https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html#modify-routing-algorithm</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/sticky-sessions.html\">https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/sticky-sessions.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/application-load-balancer-now-supports-least-outstanding-requests-algorithm-for-load-balancing-requests/\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/11/application-load-balancer-now-supports-least-outstanding-requests-algorithm-for-load-balancing-requests/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html</a></p>\n",

You pay only for the compute time you consume. Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.</p>\n\n<p>You can use an AWS Lambda function to process messages in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

The source DB instance becomes the primary DB instance. Updates made to the primary DB instance are asynchronously copied to the read replica. When you create a read replica, you first specify an existing DB instance as the source. Then Amazon RDS takes a snapshot of the source instance and creates a read-only instance from the snapshot. Amazon RDS then uses the asynchronous replication method for the DB engine to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the primary DB instance.</p>\n\n<p>Aurora Replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations and increasing availability. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region. The DB cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of the data for the DB cluster. However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical volume to the primary instance and to Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.</p>\n\n<p>In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups. Aurora stores copies of the data in a DB cluster across multiple Availability Zones in a single AWS Region. When data is written to the primary DB instance, Aurora synchronously replicates the data across Availability Zones to six storage nodes associated with your cluster volume.</p>\n\n<p>To increase availability, you can use Aurora Replicas as failover targets.

There is a brief interruption during which read and write requests made to the primary instance fail with an exception, and the Aurora Replicas are rebooted.</p>\n\n<p>For RDS MySQL in Multi-AZ configuration, database engine version upgrades happen on both the primary and standby DB instances at the same time.

The data collected is available in milliseconds to enable real-time analytics use cases such as real-time dashboards, real-time anomaly detection, dynamic pricing, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables real-time processing of streaming big data. It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications.

Each Snowball Edge device can transport data at speeds faster than the internet. This transport is done by shipping the data in the appliances through a Regional carrier. The appliances are rugged shipping containers, complete with E Ink shipping labels. Snowball Edge devices have three options for device configurations – storage optimized, compute optimized, and with GPU.</p>\n\n<p>Snowball Edge is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. The AWS Snow Family is ideal for customers moving large batches of data at once. The AWS Snowball has a typical 5-7 days turnaround time.

Now, the IPSec based AWS VPN connection assures a speed of 1 Gbps (Gigabits per second). As 1 Byte = 8 bits, therefore you can transfer 0.125 GBps (Gigabytes per second).</p>\n\n<p>So the hourly data transfer is 0.125<em>60</em>60 = 450 GB or approximately 0.45 TB.</p>\n\n<p>So the approximate daily data transfer is 0.45 * 24 = ~ 10 TB</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the entire archived dataset of 200 TB can be transferred in 20 days. As explained above, using Snowball appliances, you can complete this data transfer in just 5-7 days. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leverage the 500 Mbps Direct Connect connection to transfer the data to S3 over the dedicated connection</strong> - We established above that a 1GBps connection would take 20 days to transfer the dataset, so the 500 Mbps Direct Connect connection would take 40 days to transfer the dataset. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>The exam would probe you on multiple scenarios around competing options to migrate data from on-premises data centers to AWS Cloud. <em>You should remember that a 1Gbps connection at full utilization can transfer approximately 10 TB of data in a day</em>.

OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed, and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises compute environments. Specifically, OpsWorks for Chef Automate provides a fully managed Chef server and suite of automation tools that give you workflow automation for continuous deployment, automated testing for compliance and security, and a user interface that gives you visibility into your nodes and their status.</p>\n\n<p>The migration results in an optimized IT infrastructure as OpsWorks for Chef Automate provides a configuration management experience that is fully compatible with Chef, including all community scripts and tooling, but without the operational overhead of managing the underlying Chef server.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Replatform the IT infrastructure to AWS Cloud by leveraging AWS Config as a configuration management service to automate the configurations of servers on AWS</strong> - AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines. You can use Config to answer questions such as - \"What did my AWS resource look like at xyz point in time?\".

Rehosting refers to a migration strategy where no cloud optimizations are done and the application is migrated as-is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rehost the IT infrastructure to AWS Cloud by leveraging AWS Elastic Beanstalk as a configuration management service to automate the configurations of servers on AWS</strong> - As explained above, Rehosting is not the correct migration strategy for the given use-case. Elastic Beanstalk makes it easier for developers to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud. Developers simply upload their application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.

They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server database engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance.

Read replicas can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region.</p>\n\n<p>Creating a Read Replica within the same Region is the correct answer.

Multi-AZ spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region.</p>\n\n<p>Enabling Multi-AZ helps make our database highly-available, but the standby database is not accessible and cannot be used for reads or write.

Secondly, Elastic Beanstalk environment is provisioned via custom commands in the EC2 instance user data (it should also be emphasized that EC2 instance user data is not the best place to trigger the creation of an Elastic Beanstalk environment) however the environment itself is not terminated at the end of the day.

Detect and analyze anomalies in KDA and send notifications via SNS</strong></p>\n\n<p>A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the table for up to 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever an application creates, updates, or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record with the primary key attributes of the items that were modified. A stream record contains information about a data modification to a single item in a DynamoDB table.</p>\n\n<p>DynamoDB Streams supports the following stream record views:</p>\n\n<p>KEYS_ONLY — Only the key attributes of the modified item\nNEW_IMAGE — The entire item, as it appears after it was modified\nOLD_IMAGE — The entire item, as it appears before it was modified\nNEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES — Both the new and the old images of the item</p>\n\n<p>You can process DynamoDB streams in multiple ways. The most common approaches use AWS Lambda or a standalone application that uses the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) with the DynamoDB Streams Kinesis Adapter. The KCL is a client-side library that provides an interface to process DynamoDB stream changes. If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with an AWS Lambda function that you write. Immediately after an item in the table is modified, a new record appears in the table's stream.

If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for DynamoDB. The CloudTrail does not support the GetRecords API for DynamoDB Streams so you cannot use it to capture the actual records. Moreover, you cannot use CloudTrail event filtering to analyze anomalous behaviors as it is just a simple filtering mechanism based on certain event attributes such as Read Only, Event Source, Event Time etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure event patterns in EventBridge events to capture DynamoDB API call events and set up Lambda function as a target to analyze anomalous behavior. Send SNS notifications when anomalous behaviors are detected</strong> - EventBridge events service does not offer event type for DynamoDB as it's dependent on ClodTrail to get the relevant API call information.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Centralized VPC Endpoints for connecting with multiple VPCs, also known as shared services VPC</strong> - A VPC endpoint allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services without requiring an Internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Endpoints are virtual devices that are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.</p>\n\n<p>VPC endpoints enable you to reduce data transfer charges resulting from network communication between private VPC resources (such as Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute—or EC2—instances) and AWS Services (such as Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, or QLDB). Without VPC endpoints configured, communications that originate from within a VPC destined for public AWS services must egress AWS to the public Internet in order to access AWS services. This network path incurs outbound data transfer charges. Data transfer charges for traffic egressing from Amazon EC2 to the Internet vary based on volume. With VPC endpoints configured, communication between your VPC and the associated AWS service does not leave the Amazon network. If your workload requires you to transfer significant volumes of data between your VPC and AWS, you can reduce costs by leveraging VPC endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>In larger multi-account AWS environments, network design can vary considerably. Consider an organization that has built a hub-and-spoke network with AWS Transit Gateway. VPCs have been provisioned into multiple AWS accounts, perhaps to facilitate network isolation or to enable delegated network administration. When deploying distributed architectures such as this, a popular approach is to build a \"shared services VPC, which provides access to services required by workloads in each of the VPCs. This might include directory services or VPC endpoints. Sharing resources from a central location instead of building them in each VPC may reduce administrative overhead and cost.</p>\n\n<p>Centralized VPC Endpoints (multiple VPCs):\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt1-q46-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Transit VPC to reduce cost and share the resources across VPCs</strong> - Transit VPC uses customer-managed Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) VPN instances in a dedicated transit VPC with an Internet gateway. This design requires the customer to deploy, configure, and manage EC2-based VPN appliances, which will result in additional EC2 instances, and potentially third-party product and licensing charges. Note that this design will generate additional data transfer charges for traffic traversing the transit VPC: data is charged when it is sent from a spoke VPC to the transit VPC, and again from the transit VPC to the on-premises network or to a different AWS Region. Transit VPC is not the right choice here because it's not cost-optimal for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p>More on Transit VPC:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt1-q46-i2.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf\">https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Fully meshed VPC Peers</strong> - This approach creates multiple peering connections to facilitate the sharing of information between resources in different VPCs. This design connects multiple VPCs in a fully meshed configuration, with peering connections between each pair of VPCs. With this configuration, each VPC has access to the resources in all other VPCs. Each peering connection requires modifications to all the other VPCs’ route tables and, as the number of VPCs grows, this can be difficult to maintain. And keep in mind that AWS recommends a maximum of 125 peering connections per VPC. It's complex to manage and isn't the right fit for the current scenario.</p>\n\n<p>More on Fully meshed VPC Peers:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt1-q46-i3.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf\">https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Use VPCs connected with AWS Direct Connect</strong> - This approach is a good alternative for customers who need to connect a high number of VPCs to a central VPC or to on-premises resources, or who already have an AWS Direct Connect connection in place. This design also offers customers the ability to incorporate transitive routing into their network design.

You can use Elastic Beanstalk to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.</p>\n\n<p>A single-instance environment doesn't have a load balancer, which can help you reduce costs compared to a load-balanced, scalable environment. Use a single-instance environment if you expect your production application to have low traffic or if you are doing remote development.

        "relatedLectureIds": "",
        "feedbacks": ["", "", "", ""],
        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p>Blue/green deployment is a technique for releasing applications by shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application: \"Blue\" is the currently running version and \"green\" the new version. This type of deployment allows you to test features in the green environment without impacting the currently running version of your application. When you’re satisfied that the green version is working properly, you can gradually reroute the traffic from the old blue environment to the new green environment. Blue/green deployments can mitigate common risks associated with deploying software, such as downtime and rollback capability.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute a portion of traffic to a particular deployment</strong> - AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network, this improves the availability and performance of your internet applications. It provides two static anycast IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Elastic IP addresses or Amazon EC2 instances, in a single or in multiple AWS regions.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator uses endpoint weights to determine the proportion of traffic that is directed to endpoints in an endpoint group, and traffic dials to control the percentage of traffic that is directed to an endpoint group (an AWS region where your application is deployed).</p>\n\n<p>While relying on the DNS service is a great option for blue/green deployments, it may not fit use-cases that require a fast and controlled transition of the traffic. Some client devices and internet resolvers cache DNS answers for long periods; this DNS feature improves the efficiency of the DNS service as it reduces the DNS traffic across the Internet, and serves as a resiliency technique by preventing authoritative name-server overloads. The downside of this in blue/green deployments is that you don’t know how long it will take before all of your users receive updated IP addresses when you update a record, change your routing preference or when there is an application failure.</p>\n\n<p>With AWS Global Accelerator, you can shift traffic gradually or all at once between the blue and the green environment and vice-versa without being subject to DNS caching on client devices and internet resolvers, traffic dials and endpoint weights changes are effective within seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Route 53 weighted routing to spread traffic across different deployments</strong> - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of the software. As discussed earlier, DNS caching is a negative behavior for this use case and hence Route 53 is not a good option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across deployments</strong> - An ELB can distribute traffic across healthy instances. You can also use the ALB weighted target groups feature for blue/green deployments as it does not rely on the DNS service. In addition you don’t need to create new ALBs for the green environment. As the use-case refers to a global application, so this option cannot be used for a multi-Region solution which is needed for the given requirement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS CodeDeploy deployment options to choose the right deployment</strong> - In CodeDeploy, a deployment is the process, and the components involved in the process, of installing content on one or more instances. This content can consist of code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, and so on. CodeDeploy deploys content that is stored in a source repository, according to the configuration rules you specify. Blue/Green deployment is one of the deployment types that CodeDeploy supports. AWS CodeDeploy performs deployments with AWS resources located in the same region, so this option is ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deployments\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deployments</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted</a></p>\n",

You have full control over its lifecycle — you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as Reserved instances.</p>\n\n<p>A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time.</p>\n\n<p>Reserved Instances provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances cannot be interrupted.</p>\n\n<p>For the given use-case, only the web and application tiers would be re-engineered using API Gateway and Lambda within a duration of 6 months, so you cannot use Reserved Instances for these tiers as the minimum duration to purchase a Reserved Instance is 1 year. Additionally, using Spot Instances for these tiers is also ruled out because these can be terminated at short notice and would not be able to offer reliability for the web and application tiers. Therefore On-Demand is the best option for the web and application tiers. As the proposed transformation would not impact the database tier running on RDS MySQL, therefore you can purchase Reserved Instances for the database tier as the most cost-effective solution.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision Reserved Instances for the web, application and database tiers</strong> - As explained above, Reserved Instances are not a good fit for running the web and application tiers, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision Spot Instances for the web and application tiers and Reserved Instances for the database tier</strong> - As explained above, Spot Instances are not a good fit for running the web and application tiers, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision Reserved Instances for the web and application tiers and On-Demand Instances for the database tier</strong> - As explained above, Reserved Instances are not a good fit for running the web and application tiers, so this option is not correct.
