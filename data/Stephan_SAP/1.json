With EMR you can run Petabyte-scale analysis at less than half of the cost of traditional on-premises solutions and over 3x faster than standard Apache Spark. For short-running jobs, you can spin up and spin down clusters and pay per second for the instances used. For long-running workloads, you can create highly available clusters that automatically scale to meet demand. Amazon EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.</p>\n\n<p>Using EMR involves significant infrastructure management efforts to set up and maintain the EMR cluster. Additionally, this option involves a major development effort to write custom migration jobs to copy the database data into Redshift.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to replicate the data from the databases into Amazon Redshift</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service.

Therefore, no inbound traffic is allowed until you add inbound rules to the security group. When you first create a security group, it has an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic from the resource. You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that allow specific outbound traffic only. If your security group has no outbound rules, no outbound traffic is allowed.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt3-q1-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html</a></p>\n\n<p>For the given use case, you need to set up an outbound rule in the security group for the EC2 instance app servers using TCP protocol on port 3306 and then select the destination as the security group for the MySQL DB servers. Further, you need to set up an inbound rule in the security group for the MySQL DB servers using TCP protocol on port 3306 and then select the source as the security group for the EC2 instance app servers. This combination would let the request be initiated from the EC2 instances and allowed into the DB servers.

A common use-case for ephemeral ports: these are used in NACLs to handle response traffic. Consider a custom network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 only. It includes rules that allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic in (inbound rules 100 and 110). There's a corresponding outbound rule that enables responses to that inbound traffic (outbound rule 140, which covers ephemeral ports 32768-65535).

These could affect API availability and performance, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. For example, you can create rules to allow or block requests from specified IP address ranges, requests from CIDR blocks, requests that originate from a specific country or region, requests that contain malicious SQL code, or requests that contain malicious scripts.</p>\n\n<p>DDoS attacks are attempts by an attacker to disrupt the availability of targeted systems. For infrastructure layer attacks, you can use AWS services such as Amazon CloudFront and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to provide automatic DDoS protection.

You cannot use Amazon SQS long polling for retaining failed orders. When the wait time for the <code>ReceiveMessage</code> API action is greater than 0, long polling is in effect. Long polling helps reduce the cost of using Amazon SQS by eliminating the number of empty responses and false empty responses.

Immediately after a message is received in an SQS queue, it remains in the queue. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a <code>visibility timeout</code>, a period during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. <code>Visibility timeout</code> is a configurable parameter of SQS queues and not a temporary storage space to hold failed orders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting the web application and Amazon API Gateway for database API services.

It moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components.</p>\n\n<p>You should not use S3 to retain failed orders on an hourly basis. This would result in too many small objects (1 object for each failed order) on S3 which need to be written and read multiple times. In addition, it would be cumbersome to keep track of the failed orders and do the root cause analysis. You could run SQL queries via Athena on this underlying data in S3. However, it would turn out to be costly and inefficient while querying small objects via Athena.

Ensure that the VPC endpoint policy allows traffic from the applications</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can use an interface VPC endpoint to keep traffic between your Amazon VPC and Kinesis Data Streams from leaving the Amazon network. Interface VPC endpoints don't require an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IPs in your Amazon VPC. You do not need to change the settings for your streams, producers, or consumers. Simply create an interface VPC endpoint for your Kinesis Data Streams traffic from and to your Amazon VPC-based applications to start flowing through the interface VPC endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>VPC endpoint policies enable you to control access by either attaching a policy to a VPC endpoint or by using additional fields in a policy that is attached to an IAM user, group, or role to restrict access to only occur via the specified VPC endpoint. These policies can be used to restrict access to specific streams to a specified VPC endpoint when used in conjunction with the IAM policies to only grant access to Kinesis data stream actions via the specified VPC endpoint.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-sap-pt/assets/pt3-q2-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/vpc.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/vpc.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up an interface VPC endpoint for Kinesis Data Streams in the VPC. Ensure that the applications have the required IAM permissions to use the interface VPC endpoint</strong> - Although you can use an IAM policy to restrict access to specific streams to a specified VPC endpoint by only granting access to Kinesis data stream actions via the specified VPC endpoint. However, you need to make changes in the code for the different applications to assume the relevant IAM role and then make changes in the permissions policy attached to the IAM role to grant access to Kinesis Data Streams via the VPC endpoint. This is not an elegant solution when compared to just using the VPC endpoint policy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up a gateway VPC endpoint for Kinesis Data Streams in the VPC.

Ensure that the applications have the required IAM permissions to use the gateway VPC endpoint</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are three types of VPC endpoints. You must create the type of VPC endpoint that's required by the endpoint service.</p>\n\n<p>Interface - Create an interface endpoint to send traffic to endpoint services that use a Network Load Balancer to distribute traffic. Traffic destined for the endpoint service is resolved using DNS.</p>\n\n<p>GatewayLoadBalancer - Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to send traffic to a fleet of virtual appliances using private IP addresses. You route traffic from your VPC to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint using route tables. The Gateway Load Balancer distributes traffic to the virtual appliances and can scale with demand.</p>\n\n<p>Gateway - Create a gateway endpoint to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB using private IP addresses. You route traffic from your VPC to the gateway endpoint using route tables. Gateway endpoints do not enable AWS PrivateLink.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot set up a gateway VPC endpoint for Kinesis Data Streams. Gateway VPC endpoint is only supported for S3 and DynamoDB.
