        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon EC2 instances with Instance Store as the storage option</strong></p>\n\n<p>An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Some instance types use NVMe or SATA-based solid-state drives (SSD) to deliver high random I/O performance. This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures.</p>\n\n<p>As Instance Store delivers high random I/O performance, it can act as a temporary storage space, and these volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost, therefore this is the correct option.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon EC2 Instance Store:\n<img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/instance_storage.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) as the storage option</strong> - General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads. These volumes deliver single-digit millisecond latencies and the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods. Between a minimum of 100 IOPS (at 33.33 GiB and below) and a maximum of 16,000 IOPS (at 5,334 GiB and above), baseline performance scales linearly at 3 IOPS per GiB of volume size. AWS designs gp2 volumes to deliver its provisioned performance 99% of the time. A gp2 volume can range in size from 1 GiB to 16 TiB.\nAmazon EBS gp2 is persistent storage and costlier than Instance Stores (the cost of the storage volume is in addition to that of the Amazon EC2 instance), therefore this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) as the storage option</strong> - Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency. Unlike gp2, which uses a bucket and credit model to calculate performance, an io1 volume allows you to specify a consistent IOPS rate when you create the volume, and Amazon EBS delivers the provisioned performance 99.9 percent of the time.\nAmazon EBS io1 is persistent storage and costlier than Instance Stores (the cost of the storage volume is in addition to that of the Amazon EC2 instance), therefore this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) as the storage option</strong> - Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) are low-cost HDD volumes designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads such as Big data and Data warehouses.

SQL Server DB instances use SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM) or Always On Availability Groups (AGs).</p>\n\n<p>In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone.

It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.</p>\n\n<p>If your application is composed of several individual services, an Application Load Balancer can route a request to a service based on the content of the request.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the different types -</p>\n\n<p>Host-based Routing:\nYou can route a client request based on the Host field of the HTTP header allowing you to route to multiple domains from the same load balancer. You can use host conditions to define rules that route requests based on the hostname in the host header (also known as host-based routing). This enables you to support multiple domains using a single load balancer. Example hostnames:\nexample.com\ntest.example.com\n*.example.com\nThe rule *.example.com matches test.example.com but doesn't match example.com.</p>\n\n<p>Path-based Routing:\nYou can route a client request based on the URL path of the HTTP header. You can use path conditions to define rules that route requests based on the URL in the request (also known as path-based routing). Example path patterns:\n/img/*\n/img/<em>/pics\nThe path pattern is used to route requests but does not alter them. For example, if a rule has a path pattern of /img/</em>, the rule would forward a request for /img/picture.jpg to the specified target group as a request for /img/picture.jpg.\nThe path pattern is applied only to the path of the URL, not to its query parameters.</p>\n\n<p>HTTP header-based routing:\nYou can route a client request based on the value of any standard or custom HTTP header.</p>\n\n<p>HTTP method-based routing:\nYou can route a client request based on any standard or custom HTTP method.</p>\n\n<p>Query string parameter-based routing:\nYou can route a client request based on query string or query parameters.</p>\n\n<p>Source IP address CIDR-based routing:\nYou can route a client request based on source IP address CIDR from where the request originates.</p>\n\n<p>Path based routing and host based routing are only available for the Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Network Load Balancer operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing connections to targets - Amazon EC2 instances, microservices, and containers – within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on IP protocol data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a Classic Load Balancer</strong> - Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates at both the request level and connection level.

Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store for use as a database, cache, message broker, and queue. Redis now delivers sub-millisecond response times enabling millions of requests per second for real-time applications in Gaming, Ad-Tech, Financial Services, Healthcare, and IoT. Redis is a popular choice for caching, session management, gaming, leaderboards, real-time analytics, geospatial, ride-hailing, chat/messaging, media streaming, and pub/sub apps.</p>\n\n<p>All Redis data resides in the server’s main memory, in contrast to databases such as PostgreSQL, Cassandra, MongoDB and others that store most data on disk or on SSDs. In comparison to traditional disk based databases where most operations require a roundtrip to disk, in-memory data stores such as Redis don’t suffer the same penalty. They can therefore support an order of magnitude more operations and faster response times. The result is – blazing fast performance with average read or write operations taking less than a millisecond and support for millions of operations per second.</p>\n\n<p>Redis has purpose-built commands for working with real-time geospatial data at scale. You can perform operations like finding the distance between two elements (for example people or places) and finding all elements within a given distance of a point.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached</strong> - Both Redis and MemCached are in-memory, open-source data stores.

This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.</p>\n\n<p>You can specify instance store volumes for an instance only when you launch it. You can't detach an instance store volume from one instance and attach it to a different instance.</p>\n\n<p>Some instance types use NVMe or SATA-based solid-state drives (SSD) to deliver high random I/O performance. This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, Amazon S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. To keep costs low yet suitable for varying needs, Amazon S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from a few minutes to hours. You can upload objects directly to Amazon S3 Glacier, or use S3 Lifecycle policies to transfer data between any of the Amazon S3 Storage Classes for active data (S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA) and S3 Glacier.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon S3 standard storage for maximum performance, Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering for intelligent, durable storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive for archival storage</strong> - Amazon EC2 instance store volumes provide the best I/O performance for low latency requirement, as in the current use case. The Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3’s lowest-cost storage class and supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed once or twice a year. It is designed for customers — particularly those in highly-regulated industries, such as the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Public Sectors — that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet regulatory compliance requirements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage</strong> - Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. Amazon EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage. For high I/O performance, instance store volumes are a better option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, AWS Storage Gateway for on-premises durable data access and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive for archival storage</strong> - AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.

For example, what if your application is running fine on Amazon EC2, but the load balancer itself isn't reachable? Or if your load balancer and your Amazon EC2 instances are working correctly, but a bug in your code causes your application to crash? Or how about if the Amazon EC2 instances in one Availability Zone of a multi-AZ ELB are experiencing problems?</p>\n\n<p>Amazon Route 53 DNS Failover handles all of these failure scenarios by integrating with ELB behind the scenes. Once enabled, Route 53 automatically configures and manages health checks for individual ELB nodes. Amazon Route 53 also takes advantage of the Amazon EC2 instance health checking that ELB performs (information on configuring your ELB health checks is available here). By combining the results of health checks of your Amazon EC2 instances and your ELBs, Amazon Route 53 DNS Failover can evaluate the health of the load balancer and the health of the application running on the Amazon EC2 instances behind it. In other words, if any part of the stack goes down, Amazon Route 53 detects the failure and routes traffic away from the failed endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>Using Amazon Route 53 DNS Failover, you can run your primary application simultaneously in multiple AWS regions around the world and failover across regions. Your end-users will be routed to the closest (by latency), healthy region for your application. Amazon Route 53 automatically removes from service any region where your application is unavailable - it will pull an endpoint out of service if there is region-wide connectivity or operational issue, if your application goes down in that region, or if your ELB or Amazon EC2 instances go down in that region.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable an ALB health check</strong> - ELB health check verifies that a specified TCP port on an instance is accepting connections or a specified page has returned an error code of 200. It is not useful for the given failover scenario.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable an Amazon EC2 instance health check</strong> - Instance status checks monitor the software and network configuration of your instance. It is not intelligent enough to understand if the application on the instance is working correctly. Hence, this is not the right choice for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure AWS Trusted Advisor to check on unhealthy instances</strong> - AWS Trusted Advisor examines the health check configuration for Auto Scaling groups. If Elastic Load Balancing is being used for an Auto Scaling group, the recommended configuration is to enable an Elastic Load Balancing health check. AWS Trusted Advisor recommends certain configuration changes by comparing your system configurations to AWS Best practices. It cannot handle a failover the way Amazon Route 53 does.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-route-53-elb-integration-dns-failover/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-route-53-elb-integration-dns-failover/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/</a></p>\n",

It is used to transfer data and cannot be used to facilitate ongoing updates to the migrated files from the on-premises applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use File Gateway configuration of AWS Storage Gateway to migrate data to Amazon S3 and then use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) for ongoing updates from the on-premises applications</strong> - File Gateway can be used to move on-premises data to AWS Cloud, but it not an optimal solution for high volumes. Migration services such as AWS DataSync are best suited for this purpose. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration cannot facilitate ongoing updates to the migrated files from the on-premises applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) to migrate existing data to Amazon S3 and then use AWS DataSync for ongoing updates from the on-premises applications</strong> -  If your application is already integrated with the Amazon S3 API, and you want higher throughput for transferring large files to Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can be used. However AWS DataSync cannot be used to facilitate ongoing updates to the migrated files from the on-premises applications.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/features/\">https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/features/</a></p>\n",

AWS Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment and makes recommendations for saving money, improving system performance, or closing security gaps. It scans your AWS infrastructure and compares it to AWS Best practices in five categories (Cost Optimization, Performance, Security, Fault Tolerance, Service limits) and then provides recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>How AWS Trusted Advisor Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/AWS%20Support/AWS-trusted-advisor.5b9909d5f29f680eeb12ccff536e8d88d8701304.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Config</strong> - AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines. You can use Config to answer questions such as - “What did my AWS resource look like at xyz point in time?”. It does not offer any feedback about architectural best practices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Management Console</strong> - The AWS Management Console is a web application that comprises and refers to a broad collection of service consoles for managing Amazon Web Services.
