You can use Elastic Load Balancing to manage incoming requests by optimally routing traffic so that no one instance is overwhelmed.</p>\n\n<p>To use Elastic Load Balancing with your Auto Scaling group, you attach the load balancer to your Auto Scaling group to register the group with the load balancer. Your load balancer acts as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto Scaling group.</p>\n\n<p>When you use Elastic Load Balancing with your Auto Scaling group, it's not necessary to register individual Amazon EC2 instances with the load balancer.

You can use groups to specify permissions for a collection of users, which can make those permissions easier to manage for those users. For example, you could have a group called Admins and give that group the types of permissions that administrators typically need. Any user in that group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the group. If a new user joins your organization and should have administrator privileges, you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to that group.</p>\n\n<p>Here creating a group, assigning users to that group and attaching policies to that group is the best way.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update the Amazon S3 bucket policy</strong> - Updating the Amazon S3 bucket policy could work but would not scale, as the size of the S3 bucket policy is limited (Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a policy and assign it manually to the 50 users</strong> - An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS. The IAM user represents the person or service who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS.

Each cluster runs an Amazon Redshift engine and contains one or more databases. An Amazon Redshift cluster consists of nodes. Each cluster has a leader node and one or more compute nodes. The leader node receives queries from client applications, parses the queries, and develops query execution plans. The leader node then coordinates the parallel execution of these plans with the compute nodes and aggregates the intermediate results from these nodes. It then finally returns the results to the client applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Athena</strong> - Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.

They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server database engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines' native asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source database instance. Read replicas can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region.</p>\n\n<p>Creating a Read Replica is the answer. As we want to minimize the costs, we need to launch the Read Replica in the same Region as you are not charged for the data transfer incurred in replicating data between your source database instance and read replica within the same AWS Region.</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>Please review this comparison vis-a-vis Multi-AZ vs Read Replica for Amazon RDS:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt6-q19-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable Multi-AZ for the Amazon RDS database and run the analytics workload on the standby database</strong> - Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for RDS database (DB) instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Multi-AZ spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region.</p>\n\n<p>Enabling Multi-AZ helps make our database highly-available, but the standby database is not accessible and cannot be used for reads or write. It's just a database that will become primary when the other database encounters a failure. So this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Migrate the analytics application to AWS Lambda</strong>- AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.</p>\n\n<p>Running the application on AWS Lambda will not help, as it will still run against the main database and slow down our e-commerce application.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a Read Replica in another Region as the Master database and point the analytics workload there</strong> - This is incorrect because we have to pay for inter-Region data replication charges for the Read Replica, whereas the replication of data within a single Region is free.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/</a></p>\n",

This allows your application to make fewer API calls and have a higher throughput when the traffic to each temporary queue is low.

This client makes it easy to create and delete many temporary messaging destinations without inflating your AWS bill. The key concept behind the client is the virtual queue.

Dead-letter queues are useful for debugging your application or messaging system because they let you isolate problematic messages to determine why their processing doesn't succeed. Amazon SQS does not create the dead-letter queue automatically. You must first create the queue before using it as a dead-letter queue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues</strong> - Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. FIFO queues also provide exactly-once processing but have a limited number of transactions per second (TPS).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) delay queues</strong> - Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of seconds, for example, when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages.

Multi-AZ deployments are designed to provide enhanced database availability and durability, rather than read scaling benefits.

Network Load Balancer operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing connections to targets - Amazon EC2 instances, microservices, and containers – within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on IP protocol data.</p>\n\n<p>Including bastion hosts in your VPC environment enables you to securely connect to your Linux instances without exposing your environment to the Internet. After you set up your bastion hosts, you can access the other instances in your VPC through Secure Shell (SSH) connections on Linux. Bastion hosts are also configured with security groups to provide fine-grained ingress control.</p>\n\n<p>You need to remember that Bastion Hosts are using the SSH protocol, which is a TCP based protocol on port 22. They must be publicly accessible.</p>\n\n<p>Here, the correct answer is to use a Network Load Balancer, which supports TCP traffic, and will automatically allow you to connect to the Amazon EC2 instance in the backend.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create an elastic IP address (EIP) and assign it to all Amazon EC2 instances that are bastion hosts managed by an Auto Scaling Group</strong> - An elastic IP address (EIP) can only be attached to one Amazon EC2 instance at a time, so it won't provide you a highly available setup on its own. Note that if we had two Elastic IPs and two Bastion Hosts, this would work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a VPC Endpoint for a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that are bastion hosts managed by an Auto Scaling Group</strong> - A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.</p>\n\n<p>VPC Endpoints are not used on top of Amazon EC2 instances. They're a way to access AWS services privately within your VPC (without using the public internet). This is a distractor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a public Application Load Balancer that links to Amazon EC2 instances that are bastion hosts managed by an Auto Scaling Group</strong> - Application Load Balancer (ALB) operates at the request level (layer 7), routing traffic to targets – Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses and AWS Lambda functions based on the content of the request. Ideal for advanced load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic, Application Load Balancer provides advanced request routing targeted at delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and container-based applications.</p>\n\n<p>An Application Load Balancer only supports HTTP traffic, which is layer 7, while the SSH protocol is based on TCP and is layer 4.

When using partition placement groups, Amazon EC2 divides each group into logical segments called partitions. Amazon EC2 ensures that each partition within a placement group has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and power source. No two partitions within a placement group share the same racks, allowing you to isolate the impact of a hardware failure within your application.</p>\n\n<p>The following image is a simple visual representation of a partition placement group in a single Availability Zone. It shows instances that are placed into a partition placement group with three partitions—Partition 1, Partition 2, and Partition 3. Each partition comprises multiple instances. The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions, allowing you to contain the impact of a single hardware failure to only the associated partition.</p>\n\n<p>Partition placement groups can be used to deploy large distributed and replicated workloads, such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra, across distinct racks. When you launch instances into a partition placement group, Amazon EC2 tries to distribute the instances evenly across the number of partitions that you specify.

To accommodate this, Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throughput levels for periods of time. By default, AWS recommends that you run your application in the Bursting Throughput mode. But, if you're planning to migrate large amounts of data into your file system, consider switching to Provisioned Throughput mode.</p>\n\n<p>The use-case mentions that the solution should be optimized for high-frequency reading and writing even when the old outputs are archived, therefore Provisioned Throughput mode is a better fit as it guarantees high levels of throughput your applications require without having to pad your file system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use an Amazon EBS volume mounted to the Amazon ECS cluster instances</strong> - Amazon EFS has a higher throughput than Amazon EBS. In addition, Amazon EBS can be attached to multiple Amazon EC2 instances when the underlying EBS type is io1/io2 and the instance is of Nitro type. The use-case does not provide any such details, so this option is ruled out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB table that is accessible by all ECS cluster instances</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB is not a fit for this scenario as each task output is 20 MB but the storage limit for each item in a Amazon DynamoDB table is 400 KB. You could write custom code to split the task output data into multiple items but it is not an optimal solution compared to using Amazon EFS in Provisioned Throughput mode.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html#limits-items\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html#limits-items</a></p>\n",

An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM.

An instance profile is a container for a role that can be attached to an Amazon EC2 instance when launched. An instance profile can contain only one role, and that limit cannot be increased.

This allows you to focus on your ETL job and not worry about configuring and managing the underlying compute resources. AWS Glue takes a data-first approach and allows you to focus on the data properties and data manipulation to transform the data to a form where you can derive business insights. It provides an integrated data catalog that makes metadata available for ETL as well as querying via Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>Create a unified catalog to find data across multiple data stores using AWS Glue:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt6-q48-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glue/\">https://aws.amazon.com/glue/</a></p>\n\n<p>AWS Glue automates much of the effort required for data integration. AWS Glue crawls your data sources, identifies data formats, and suggests schemas to store your data. It automatically generates the code to run your data transformations and loading processes. You can use AWS Glue to easily run and manage thousands of ETL jobs or to combine and replicate data across multiple data stores using SQL.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Glue runs in a serverless environment. There is no infrastructure to manage, and AWS Glue provisions, configures, and scales the resources required to run your data integration jobs.

AWS Data Pipeline launches compute resources in your account allowing you direct access to the Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon EMR clusters. As this option provides access to the underlying EC2 instances so it's not a serverless solution. Therefore this option is incorrect for the given use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong> - EMR is a web service to easily and cost-effectively process vast amounts of data. EMR utilizes a hosted Hadoop framework running on the web-scale infrastructure of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). As this option provides access to the underlying Amazon EC2 instances so it's not a serverless solution. Therefore this option is incorrect for the given use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)</strong> - AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) helps you migrate databases to AWS easily and securely. For use cases that require a database migration from on-premises to AWS or database replication between on-premises sources and sources on AWS, AWS recommends you use AWS DMS. Once your data is in AWS, you can use AWS Glue to move, combine, replicate, and transform data from your data source into another database or data warehouse, such as Amazon Redshift. As the use-case talks about data migration and transformation between AWS services, so AWS Glue is a better fit than DMS.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/glue/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/glue/faqs/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/load-data-from-amazon-s3-to-amazon-redshift-using-aws-glue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/load-data-from-amazon-s3-to-amazon-redshift-using-aws-glue.html</a></p>\n",

Point the reporting queries to run against the standby instance</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a standby instance in a multi-AZ configuration with half compute capacity and half storage capacity as the primary. Point the reporting queries to run against the standby instance</strong></p>\n\n<p>Multi-AZ deployments are not a read scaling solution, so you cannot use a standby to serve read traffic. The standby is there just for failover. Hence both these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html\">https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html</a></p>\n",

The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory data stores, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.</p>\n\n<p>Memcached is an open-source, distributed, in-memory key-value store that can retrieve data in milliseconds. Caching site information with Memcached can help you improve the performance and scalability of your site while controlling cost.</p>\n\n<p>Choose Memcached if the following apply to you:</p>\n\n<p>You need the simplest model possible.</p>\n\n<p>You need to run large nodes with multiple cores or threads (support for multi-threading).</p>\n\n<p>You need the ability to scale out and in, adding and removing nodes as demand on your system increases and decreases.</p>\n\n<p>You need to cache objects.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt6-q47-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis-vs-memcached/\">https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis-vs-memcached/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</strong> - Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store for use as a database, cache, message broker, and queue. Redis now delivers sub-millisecond response times enabling millions of requests per second for real-time applications in Gaming, Ad-Tech, Financial Services, Healthcare, and IoT. Redis is a popular choice for caching, session management, gaming, leaderboards, real-time analytics, geospatial, ride-hailing, chat/messaging, media streaming, and pub/sub apps.</p>\n\n<p>Redis does not support multi-threading, so this option is not the right fit for the given use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX does not support relational databases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Global Accelerator</strong> - AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that helps you improve the availability and performance of the applications that you offer to your global users.
