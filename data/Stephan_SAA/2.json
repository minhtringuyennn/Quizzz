When you use a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a username and password or access keys) to an Amazon EC2 instance. The role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use when they make calls to other AWS resources.

You can leverage an AWS Config managed rule to check if any ACM certificates in your account are marked for expiration within the specified number of days.

Metrics and events provide you visibility into such certificates that require intervention to continue the renewal process. Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon EventBridge events are enabled for all certificates that are managed by ACM. Users can monitor <code>days to expiry</code> as a metric for ACM certificates through Amazon CloudWatch.

An Aurora cluster volume is a virtual database storage volume that spans multiple Availability Zones (AZs), with each Availability Zone (AZ) having a copy of the DB cluster data. Two types of DB instances make up an Aurora DB cluster:</p>\n\n<p>Primary DB instance – Supports read and write operations, and performs all of the data modifications to the cluster volume. Each Aurora DB cluster has one primary DB instance.</p>\n\n<p>Aurora Replica – Connects to the same storage volume as the primary DB instance and supports only read operations. Each Aurora DB cluster can have up to 15 Aurora Replicas in addition to the primary DB instance. Aurora automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica in case the primary DB instance becomes unavailable. You can specify the failover priority for Aurora Replicas. Aurora Replicas can also offload read workloads from the primary DB instance.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/AuroraArch001.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Aurora Replicas have two main purposes. You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That way, Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer.</p>\n\n<p>While setting up a Multi-AZ deployment for Aurora, you create an Aurora replica or reader node in a different Availability Zone (AZ).</p>\n\n<p>Multi-AZ for Aurora:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q13-i1.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>You use the reader endpoint for read-only connections for your Aurora cluster. This endpoint uses a load-balancing mechanism to help your cluster handle a query-intensive workload. The reader endpoint is the endpoint that you supply to applications that do reporting or other read-only operations on the cluster. The reader endpoint load-balances connections to available Aurora Replicas in an Aurora DB cluster.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q13-i2.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision another Amazon Aurora database and link it to the primary database as a read replica</strong> - You cannot provision another Aurora database and then link it as a read-replica for the primary database.

VPCs have been provisioned into multiple AWS accounts, perhaps to facilitate network isolation or to enable delegated network administration. When deploying distributed architectures such as this, a popular approach is to build a \"shared services VPC, which provides access to services required by workloads in each of the VPCs. This might include directory services or VPC endpoints. Sharing resources from a central location instead of building them in each VPC may reduce administrative overhead and cost.</p>\n\n<p>Centralized VPC Endpoints (multiple VPCs):\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q21-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/</a></p>\n\n<p>A VPC endpoint allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services without requiring an Internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Endpoints are virtual devices that are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.</p>\n\n<p>VPC endpoints enable you to reduce data transfer charges resulting from network communication between private VPC resources (such as Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute—or EC2—instances) and AWS Services (such as Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, or QLDB). Without VPC endpoints configured, communications that originate from within a VPC destined for public AWS services must egress AWS to the public Internet in order to access AWS services. This network path incurs outbound data transfer charges. Data transfer charges for traffic egressing from Amazon EC2 to the Internet vary based on volume. With VPC endpoints configured, communication between your VPC and the associated AWS service does not leave the Amazon network. If your workload requires you to transfer significant volumes of data between your VPC and AWS, you can reduce costs by leveraging VPC endpoints.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Transit VPC to reduce cost and share the resources across Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPCs)</strong> - Transit VPC uses customer-managed Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) VPN instances in a dedicated transit VPC with an Internet gateway. This design requires the customer to deploy, configure, and manage EC2-based VPN appliances, which will result in additional EC2, and potentially third-party product and licensing charges. Note that this design will generate additional data transfer charges for traffic traversing the transit VPC: data is charged when it is sent from a spoke VPC to the transit VPC, and again from the transit VPC to the on-premises network or a different AWS Region. Transit VPC is not the right choice here.</p>\n\n<p>More on Transit VPC:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q21-i2.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf\">https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Fully meshed VPC Peering connection</strong> - This approach creates multiple peering connections to facilitate the sharing of information between resources in different VPCs. This design connects multiple VPCs in a fully meshed configuration, with peering connections between each pair of VPCs. With this configuration, each VPC has access to the resources in all other VPCs. Each peering connection requires modifications to all the other VPCs’ route tables and, as the number of VPCs grows, this can be difficult to maintain. And keep in mind that AWS recommends a maximum of 125 peering connections per VPC. It's complex to manage and isn't a right fit for the current scenario.</p>\n\n<p>More on Fully meshed VPC Peers:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q21-i3.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf\">https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Use VPCs connected with AWS Direct Connect</strong> - This approach is a good alternative for customers who need to connect a high number of VPCs to a central VPC or on-premises resources, or who already have an AWS Direct Connect connection in place. This design also offers customers the ability to incorporate transitive routing into their network design. For example, if VPC A and VPC B are both connected to an on-premises network using AWS Direct Connect connections, then the two VPCs can be connected to each other via AWS Direct Connect. AWS Direct Connect requires physical cables and takes about a month for setting up, this is not an ideal solution for the given scenario.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf\">https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf</a></p>\n",

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p>Blue/green deployment is a technique for releasing applications by shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application: \"Blue\" is the currently running version and \"green\" the new version. This type of deployment allows you to test features in the green environment without impacting the currently running version of your application. When you’re satisfied that the green version is working properly, you can gradually reroute the traffic from the old blue environment to the new green environment. Blue/green deployments can mitigate common risks associated with deploying software, such as downtime and rollback capability.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute a portion of traffic to a particular deployment</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network, this improves the availability and performance of your internet applications. It provides two static anycast IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Elastic IP addresses or Amazon EC2 instances, in a single or in multiple AWS regions.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator uses endpoint weights to determine the proportion of traffic that is directed to endpoints in an endpoint group, and traffic dials to control the percentage of traffic that is directed to an endpoint group (an AWS region where your application is deployed).</p>\n\n<p>While relying on the DNS service is a great option for blue/green deployments, it may not fit use-cases that require a fast and controlled transition of the traffic. Some client devices and internet resolvers cache DNS answers for long periods; this DNS feature improves the efficiency of the DNS service as it reduces the DNS traffic across the Internet, and serves as a resiliency technique by preventing authoritative name-server overloads. The downside of this in blue/green deployments is that you don’t know how long it will take before all of your users receive updated IP addresses when you update a record, change your routing preference or when there is an application failure.</p>\n\n<p>With AWS Global Accelerator, you can shift traffic gradually or all at once between the blue and the green environment and vice-versa without being subject to DNS caching on client devices and internet resolvers, traffic dials and endpoint weights changes are effective within seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Route 53 weighted routing to spread traffic across different deployments</strong> - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of the software. As discussed earlier, DNS caching is a negative behavior for this use case and hence Amazon Route 53 is not a good option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic across deployments</strong> - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) can distribute traffic across healthy instances. You can also use the Application Load Balancers weighted target groups feature for blue/green deployments as it does not rely on the DNS service. In addition you don’t need to create new ALBs for the green environment. As the use-case refers to a global application, so this option cannot be used for a multi-Region solution which is needed for the given requirement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS CodeDeploy deployment options to choose the right deployment</strong> - In AWS CodeDeploy, a deployment is the process, and the components involved in the process, of installing content on one or more instances. This content can consist of code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy deploys content that is stored in a source repository, according to the configuration rules you specify. Blue/Green deployment is one of the deployment types that CodeDeploy supports. CodeDeploy is not meant to distribute traffic across instances, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deployments\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deployments</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted</a></p>\n",

Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single-payer account. However, Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances.</p>\n\n<p>A Dedicated Host is also a physical server that's dedicated for your use.

Your Spot Instance runs whenever capacity is available and the maximum price per hour for your request exceeds the Spot price. Any instance present with unused capacity will be allocated. Even though this is cost-effective, it does not fulfill the single-tenant hardware requirement of the client and hence is not the correct option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Hosts</strong> - An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your existing software licenses on EC2 instances. With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server. This option is costlier than the Dedicated Instance and hence is not the right choice for the current requirement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>On-Demand Instances</strong> - With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. You have full control over its lifecycle—you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. Hardware isolation is not possible and on-demand has one of the costliest instance charges and hence is not the correct answer for current requirements.</p>\n\n<p>High Level Overview of Amazon EC2 Instance Purchase Options:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q23-i2.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html</a></p>\n",

You can leverage Amazon Cognito User Pools to either provide built-in user management or integrate with external identity providers, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Amazon.

API Gateway API Keys is not a security mechanism and should not be used for authorization unless it’s a public API. It should be used primarily to track a consumer’s usage across your API.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Lambda authorizer for Amazon API Gateway</strong> - If you have an existing Identity Provider (IdP), you can use an AWS Lambda authorizer for Amazon API Gateway to invoke a Lambda function to authenticate/validate a given user against your Identity Provider. You can use a Lambda authorizer for custom validation logic based on identity metadata.</p>\n\n<p>A Lambda authorizer can send additional information derived from a bearer token or request context values to your backend service. For example, the authorizer can return a map containing user IDs, user names, and scope. By using Lambda authorizers, your backend does not need to map authorization tokens to user-centric data, allowing you to limit the exposure of such information to just the authorization function.</p>\n\n<p>When using Lambda authorizers, AWS strictly advises against passing credentials or any sort of sensitive data via query string parameters or headers, so this is not as secure as using Amazon Cognito User Pools.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, both these options do not offer built-in user management.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Cognito Identity Pools</strong> - The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services. To enable users in your user pool to access AWS resources, you can configure an identity pool to exchange user pool tokens for AWS credentials. So, identity pools aren't an authentication mechanism in themselves and hence aren't a choice for this use case.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enable-cognito-user-pool.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enable-cognito-user-pool.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html</a></p>\n",

You can share AWS Transit Gateways, Subnets, AWS License Manager configurations, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver rules resources with RAM. RAM eliminates the need to create duplicate resources in multiple accounts, reducing the operational overhead of managing those resources in every single account you own. You can create resources centrally in a multi-account environment, and use RAM to share those resources across accounts in three simple steps: create a Resource Share, specify resources, and specify accounts. RAM is available to you at no additional charge.</p>\n\n<p>The correct solution is to share the subnet(s) within a VPC using RAM.

AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely on the Amazon network.\nPrivate Link is a distractor in this question. Private Link is leveraged to create a private connection between an application that is fronted by an NLB in an account, and an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in another account, without the need of VPC peering and allowing the connections between the two to remain within the AWS network.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a VPC peering connection between all virtual private cloud (VPCs)</strong> - A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.

Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices provide both block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage, and 40 vCPUs. They are well suited for local storage and large scale data transfer. AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized devices provide 52 vCPUs, block and object storage, and an optional GPU for use cases like advanced machine learning and full-motion video analysis in disconnected environments.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80 terabytes of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 terabyte of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 gigabytes network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.</p>\n\n<p>The original AWS Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer. You may see the AWS Snowball device on the exam, just remember that the original AWS Snowball device had 80 terabytes of storage space.</p>\n\n<p>For this scenario, you will want to minimize the time spent in Amazon S3 Standard for all files to avoid unintended Amazon S3 Standard storage charges. To do this, AWS recommends using a zero-day lifecycle policy. From a cost perspective, when using a zero-day lifecycle policy, you are only charged Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive rates. When billed, the lifecycle policy is accounted for first, and if the destination is Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, you are charged Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive rates for the transferred files.</p>\n\n<p>You can't move data directly from AWS Snowball into Amazon S3 Glacier, you need to go through Amazon S3 first, and then use a lifecycle policy.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leverage Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas and create the dev database by restoring from the automated backups of Amazon Aurora</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. An Amazon Aurora DB cluster consists of one or more DB instances and a cluster volume that manages the data for those DB instances. An Aurora cluster volume is a virtual database storage volume that spans multiple Availability Zones (AZs), with each Availability Zone (AZ) having a copy of the Amazon Aurora DB cluster data. Aurora supports Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas that improve the application's read-scaling and availability.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon Aurora Overview:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/Product-Page-Diagram_Amazon-Aurora_How-it-Works.b1c2b37e7548757780b195c6dcceb58511de5b1d.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/</a></p>\n\n<p>Aurora backs up your cluster volume automatically and retains restore data for the length of the backup retention period. Aurora backups are continuous and incremental so you can quickly restore to any point within the backup retention period. No performance impact or interruption of database service occurs as backup data is being written.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q52-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Automated backups occur daily during the preferred backup window. If the backup requires more time than allotted to the backup window, the backup continues after the window ends, until it finishes. The backup window can't overlap with the weekly maintenance window for the DB cluster. Aurora backups are continuous and incremental, but the backup window is used to create a daily system backup that is preserved within the backup retention period. The latest restorable time for a DB cluster is the most recent point at which you can restore your DB cluster, typically within 5 minutes of the current time.</p>\n\n<p>For the given use case, you can create the dev database by restoring from the automated backups of Amazon Aurora.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leverage Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas and restore the dev database via mysqldump</strong> - Restoring the dev database via mysqldump would still result in a significant load on the primary DB, so this option fails to address the given requirement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leverage Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and use the standby instance as the dev database</strong> - The standby is there just for handling failover in a Multi-AZ deployment. You cannot access the standby instance and use it as a dev database. Hence this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leverage Amazon RDS for SQL server with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas. Use the read replica as the dev database</strong> - Amazon RDS supports Multi-AZ deployments for Microsoft SQL Server by using either SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM) or Always On Availability Groups (AGs). Amazon RDS monitors and maintains the health of your Multi-AZ deployment.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-AZ deployments provide increased availability, data durability, and fault tolerance for DB instances. In the event of planned database maintenance or unplanned service disruption, Amazon RDS automatically fails over to the up-to-date secondary DB instance. For SQL Server, I/O activity is suspended briefly during backup for Multi-AZ deployments.</p>\n\n<p>A read replica is only meant to serve read traffic. The primary purpose of the read replica is to replicate the data in the primary DB instance. A read replica cannot be used as a dev database because it does not allow any database write operations.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.ReadReplicas.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.ReadReplicas.html</a></p>\n",

The service enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. Users and applications retrieve secrets with a call to Secrets Manager APIs, eliminating the need to hardcode sensitive information in plain text. Secrets Manager offers secret rotation with built-in integration for Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon DocumentDB. The correct answer here is Secrets Manager</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)</strong> - AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a service that combines secure, highly available hardware and software to provide a key management system scaled for the cloud. When you use server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), you can specify a customer-managed CMK that you have already created. SSE-KMS provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom. KMS is an encryption service, it's not a secrets store. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS CloudHSM</strong> - AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. With AWS CloudHSM, you can manage your encryption keys using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs. AWS CloudHSM is standards-compliant and enables you to export all of your keys to most other commercially-available HSMs, subject to your configurations. It is a fully-managed service that automates time-consuming administrative tasks for you, such as hardware provisioning, software patching, high-availability, and backups.</p>\n\n<p>AWS CloudHSM is also an encryption service, not a secrets store. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store</strong> - AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (aka SSM Parameter Store) provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management. You can store data such as passwords, database strings, Amazon EC2 instance IDs, Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs, and license codes as parameter values. You can store values as plain text or encrypted data. You can reference Systems Manager parameters in your scripts, commands, SSM documents, and configuration and automation workflows by using the unique name that you specified when you created the parameter.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store can serve as a secrets store, but you must rotate the secrets yourself, it doesn't have an automatic capability for this.

It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. RDS allows you to create, read, update, and delete records without any item lock or ambiguity. All RDS transactions must be ACID compliant or be Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable to ensure data integrity.</p>\n\n<p>Atomicity requires that either transaction as a whole is successfully executed or if a part of the transaction fails, then the entire transaction be invalidated. Consistency mandates the data written to the database as part of the transaction must adhere to all defined rules, and restrictions including constraints, cascades, and triggers. Isolation is critical to achieving concurrency control and makes sure each transaction is independent unto itself. Durability requires that all of the changes made to the database be permanent once a transaction is completed.\nHence, the best fit is Amazon RDS.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon ElastiCache</strong> - Amazon ElastiCache allows you to seamlessly set up, run, and scale popular open-source compatible in-memory data stores in the cloud. Build data-intensive apps or boost the performance of your existing databases by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores, Gaming, Geospatial Services, Real-Time Analytics, and Queuing. ElastiCache could work but it's a better fit as a caching technology to enhance reads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</strong> - This option is incorrect as Amazon S3 is not a database technology that supports queries on database tables out of the box. It is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Your applications can easily achieve thousands of transactions per second in request performance when uploading and retrieving storage from Amazon S3.</p>\n\n<p>After a successful write of a new object or an overwrite of an existing object, any subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object. Amazon S3 also provides strong consistency for list operations, so after a write, you can immediately perform a listing of the objects in a bucket with any changes reflected. Strong read-after-write consistency helps when you need to immediately read an object after a write. For example, strong read-after-write consistency when you often read and list immediately after writing objects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Neptune</strong> - Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon Neptune is highly available, with read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across Availability Zones. Neptune is secure with support for HTTPS encrypted client connections and encryption at rest. Amazon Neptune is fully managed, so you no longer need to worry about database management tasks such as hardware provisioning, software patching, setup, configuration, or backups. Amazon Neptune is a graph database so it's not a good fit.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/relational-database/\">https://aws.amazon.com/relational-database/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/\">https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#ConsistencyModel\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Introduction.html#ConsistencyModel</a></p>\n",

Highly parallelized applications and workloads, such as big data analysis, media processing, and genomic analysis, can benefit from this mode.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q64-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provisioned Throughput</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bursting Throughput</strong></p>\n\n<p>These two options have been added as distractors as these refer to the throughput mode of Amazon EFS and not the performance mode. There are two throughput modes to choose from for your file system, Bursting Throughput and Provisioned Throughput. With Bursting Throughput mode, throughput on Amazon EFS scales as the size of your file system in the standard storage class grows. With Provisioned Throughput mode, you can instantly provision the throughput of your file system (in MiB/s) independent of the amount of data stored.</p>\n\n<p><strong>General Purpose</strong> - General Purpose performance mode is ideal for latency-sensitive use cases, like web serving environments, content management systems, home directories, and general file serving. If you don't choose a performance mode when you create your file system, Amazon EFS selects the General Purpose mode for you by default.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/efs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/efs/</a></p>\n",

As no such information has been provided for the given use-case, so this criterion can be ignored. The next priority is to consider any instance with the oldest launch template unless there is an instance that uses a launch configuration. So this rules out Instance A. Next, you need to consider any instance which has the oldest launch configuration. This implies Instance B will be selected for termination and Instance C will also be ruled out as it has the newest launch configuration. Instance D, which is closest to the next billing hour, is not selected as this criterion is last in the order of priority.</p>\n\n<p>Please see this note for a deep-dive on the default termination policy:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q65-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instance A</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Instance C</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Instance D</strong></p>\n\n<p>These three options contradict the explanation provided above, so these options are incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html</a></p>\n",
