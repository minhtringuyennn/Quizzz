Because DAX is API-compatible with DynamoDB, you don't have to make any functional application code changes. DAX is used to natively cache DynamoDB reads.</p>\n\n<p>CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can be more cost-effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.</p>\n\n<p>When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location. If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront retrieves it from your origin – for example, the S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content.</p>\n\n<p>So, you can use CloudFront to improve application performance to serve static content from S3.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable ElastiCache Redis for DynamoDB and CloudFront for S3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a blazing fast in-memory data store that provides sub-millisecond latency to power internet-scale real-time applications.

It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications. The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records for a given partition key to the same record processor, making it easier to build multiple applications reading from the same Amazon Kinesis data stream (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering).</p>\n\n<p>AWS recommends Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for use cases with requirements that are similar to the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Routing related records to the same record processor (as in streaming MapReduce). For example, counting and aggregation are simpler when all records for a given key are routed to the same record processor.</li>\n<li>Ordering of records. For example, you want to transfer log data from the application host to the processing/archival host while maintaining the order of log statements.</li>\n<li>Ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently. For example, you have one application that updates a real-time dashboard and another that archives data to Amazon Redshift. You want both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.</li>\n<li>Ability to consume records in the same order a few hours later. For example, you have a billing application and an audit application that runs a few hours behind the billing application. Because Amazon Kinesis Data Streams stores data for up to 365 days, you can run the audit application up to 365 days behind the billing application.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</strong> - Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

SNS is a notification service and cannot be used for real-time processing of data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</strong> - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distributed application components and helps you build applications in which messages are processed independently (with message-level ack/fail semantics), such as automated workflows. Since multiple applications need to consume the same data stream concurrently, Kinesis is a better choice when compared to the combination of SQS with SNS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)</strong> - As discussed above, Kinesis is a better option for this use case in comparison to SQS.

You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That way, Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use CloudFront distribution in front of the Application Load Balancer</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment. CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure that popular content can be served quickly to your viewers. CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your viewers, even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP, to help improve performance for that content.</p>\n\n<p>CloudFront offers an origin failover feature to help support your data resiliency needs. CloudFront is a global service that delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations or points of presence (POPs). If your content is not already cached in an edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've identified as the source for the definitive version of the content.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><em>* Use AWS Shield</em>* - AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency. There are two tiers of AWS Shield - Standard and Advanced. Shield cannot be used to improve application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Global Accelerator</strong> - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Since CloudFront is better for improving application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic, so this option is ruled out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Direct Connect</strong> - AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry-standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between your intranet and Amazon VPC. Direct Connect cannot be used to improve application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html</a></p>\n",

Also it should be noted that this solution is entirely serverless and requires no infrastructure maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>Kinesis Data Firehose to S3:\n<img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/images/fh-flow-s3.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Analytics and use SQL queries to filter and transform the data before writing to S3</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to analyze streaming data in real-time. Kinesis Data Analytics enables you to easily and quickly build queries and sophisticated streaming applications in three simple steps: setup your streaming data sources, write your queries or streaming applications, and set up your destination for processed data. Kinesis Data Analytics cannot directly ingest data from the source as it ingests data either from Kinesis Data Streams or Kinesis Data Firehose, so this option is ruled out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingest the data in Kinesis Data Streams and use an intermediary Lambda function to filter and transform the incoming stream before the output is dumped on S3</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable, highly durable data ingestion and processing service optimized for streaming data. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is integrated with a number of AWS services, including Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose for near real-time transformation.</p>\n\n<p>Kinesis Data Streams cannot directly write the output to S3. Unlike Firehose, KDS does not offer a ready-made integration via an intermediary Lambda function to reliably dump data into S3. You will need to do a lot of custom coding to get the Lambda function to process the incoming stream and then store the transformed output to S3 with the constraint that the buffer is maintained reliably and no transformed data is lost. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ingest the data in a Spark Streaming Cluster on EMR use Spark Streaming transformations before writing to S3</strong> - Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto. Amazon EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.\nUsing an EMR cluster would imply managing the underlying infrastructure so it’s ruled out because the correct solution for the given use-case should require the least amount of infrastructure maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/\">https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/</a></p>\n",

Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket</strong> - Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object.

It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.</p>\n\n<p>As each Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device can handle 80TB of data, you can order 10 such devices to take care of the data transfer for all applications.</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer. You may see the Snowball device on the exam, just remember that the original Snowball device had 80TB of storage space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Setup Site-to-Site VPN to establish on-going connectivity between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS Site-to-Site VPN enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore this option is the right fit for the given use-case as the connectivity can be easily established within the given timeframe.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Order 1 Snowmobile to complete the one-time data transfer</strong> -  Each Snowmobile has a total capacity of up to 100 petabytes. To migrate large datasets of 10PB or more in a single location, you should use Snowmobile. For datasets less than 10PB or distributed in multiple locations, you should use Snowball. So Snowmobile is not the right fit for this use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Setup AWS direct connect to establish connectivity between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud</strong> - AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry-standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between your intranet and Amazon VPC. Direct Connect involves significant monetary investment and takes at least a month to set up, therefore it's not the correct fit for this use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Order 70 Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices to complete the one-time data transfer</strong> - As the data-transfer can be completed with just 10 Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices, there is no need to order 70 devices.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/faqs/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/\">https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/faqs/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\">https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/</a></p>\n",

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Store the intermediary query results in S3 Standard storage class</strong></p>\n\n<p>S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics.\nAs there is no minimum storage duration charge and no retrieval fee (remember that intermediary query results are heavily referenced by other parts of the analytics pipeline), this is the MOST cost-effective storage class amongst the given options.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Store the intermediary query results in S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class</strong> - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval delivers the fastest access to archive storage, with the same throughput and milliseconds access as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is ideal for archive data that needs immediate access, such as medical images, news media assets, or user-generated content archives.</p>\n\n<p>The minimum storage duration charge is 90 days, so this option is NOT cost-effective because intermediary query results need to be kept only for 24 hours. Hence this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Store the intermediary query results in S3 Standard-Infrequent Access storage class</strong> - S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. S3 Standard-IA offers high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance makes S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.\nThe minimum storage duration charge is 30 days, so this option is NOT cost-effective because intermediary query results need to be kept only for 24 hours. Hence this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Store the intermediary query results in S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class</strong> - S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA.\nThe minimum storage duration charge is 30 days, so this option is NOT cost-effective because intermediary query results need to be kept only for 24 hours. Hence this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize again, S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA have a minimum storage duration charge of 30 days (so instead of 24 hours, you end up paying for 30 days). S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA also have retrieval charges (as the results are heavily referenced by other parts of the analytics pipeline, so the retrieval costs would be pretty high). Therefore, these storage classes are not cost optimal for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/\">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/</a></p>\n",

SQS offers two types of message queues - Standard queues vs FIFO queues.</p>\n\n<p>For FIFO queues, the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved (i.e. First-In-First-Out).

This means that occasionally, messages might be delivered in an order different from which they were sent.</p>\n\n<p>By default, FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second). When you batch 10 messages per operation (maximum), FIFO queues can support up to 3,000 messages per second.

To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions. When Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain (example.com or acme.example.com), it determines which AWS Regions you've created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Route 53 responds with the value from the selected record, such as the IP address for a web server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Route 53 based weighted routing policy to restrict distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights</strong> - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of the software.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Route 53 based failover routing policy to restrict distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights</strong> - Failover routing lets you route traffic to a resource when the resource is healthy or to a different resource when the first resource is unhealthy.

Your applications can easily achieve thousands of transactions per second in request performance when uploading and retrieving storage from Amazon S3. Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates. For example, your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket.</p>\n\n<p>There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by parallelizing reads. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second. Please see this example for more clarity on prefixes:\nif you have a file f1 stored in an S3 object path like so <code>s3://your_bucket_name/folder1/sub_folder_1/f1</code>, then <code>/folder1/sub_folder_1/</code> becomes the prefix for file f1.</p>\n\n<p>Some data lake applications on Amazon S3 scan millions or billions of objects for queries that run over petabytes of data.

Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon CloudFront</strong> - Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery), while Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</strong> - Both of the services, ELB and Global Accelerator solve the challenge of routing user requests to healthy application endpoints. AWS Global Accelerator relies on ELB to provide the traditional load balancing features such as support for internal and non-AWS endpoints, pre-warming, and Layer 7 routing. However, while ELB provides load balancing within one Region, AWS Global Accelerator provides traffic management across multiple Regions.</p>\n\n<p>A regional ELB load balancer is an ideal target for AWS Global Accelerator. By using a regional ELB load balancer, you can precisely distribute incoming application traffic across backends, such as Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon ECS tasks, within an AWS Region.</p>\n\n<p>If you have workloads that cater to a global client base, AWS recommends that you use AWS Global Accelerator. If you have workloads hosted in a single AWS Region and used by clients in and around the same Region, you can use an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer to manage your resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Route 53</strong> - Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.

Leverage the Auto Scaling group to replace unhealthy instances</strong></p>\n\n<p>A Network Load Balancer (NLB) functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.</p>\n\n<p>A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances. This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.</p>\n\n<p>A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure, and forwards requests to a target group. Each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the TCP protocol and the port number that you specify.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt1-q61-i3.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-health-checks.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-health-checks.html</a></p>\n\n<p>For the given use case, you need to swap out the NLB with an ALB. This would allow you to use HTTP-based health checks to detect when the web application faces errors. You can then leverage the Auto Scaling group to use the ALB's health checks to identify and replace unhealthy instances.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt1-q61-i4.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-add-elb-healthcheck.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-add-elb-healthcheck.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the UnhealthyHostCount metric for the NLB. Leverage the Auto Scaling group to replace unhealthy instances when the alarm is in the ALARM state</strong> - The Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service provides you with Amazon CloudWatch metrics (HealthyHostCount and UnhealthyHostCount) to monitor the targets behind your load balancers. Although the unhealthy host count metric gives the aggregate number of failed hosts, there is a common pain point when you create an alarm for unhealthy hosts based on these metrics. This is because there is no easy way for you to tell which target was or is unhealthy. Building a solution using the Cloudwatch alarm requires significant development/scripting effort to identify the unhealthy target, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure HTTP health checks on the Network Load Balancer (NLB) by pointing to the URL of the application. Leverage the Auto Scaling group to replace unhealthy instances</strong> - The NLB uses HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP as possible protocols when performing health checks on targets. The default is the TCP protocol. If the target type is ALB, the supported health check protocols are HTTP and HTTPS. Although it is now possible to configure an ALB as a target of an NLB, it would end up being a costlier and inefficient solution than just swapping out the NLB with the ALB, so this solution is not the best fit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up a cron job on the EC2 instances to inspect the web application's logs at a regular frequency. When HTTP errors are detected, force an application restart</strong> - This option requires significant development/scripting effort to identify the unhealthy target. It's not as elegant a solution as directly leveraging the HTTP health check capabilities of the ALB.

Amazon CloudFront uses standard cache control headers you set on your files to identify static and dynamic content.

On a static website, individual web pages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts, such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET. Amazon S3 does not support server-side scripting, but AWS has other resources for hosting dynamic websites.  So this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leverage a Route 53 geo-proximity routing policy pointing to on-premises servers</strong> - Since the on-premises servers continue to be in the US, so even using a Route 53 geo-proximity routing policy that directs the users in Asia to the on-premises servers in the US would not reduce the latency for the users in Asia.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upload the compressed file using multipart upload with S3 transfer acceleration</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.</p>\n\n<p>Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. If you're uploading large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use multipart uploading to maximize the use of your available bandwidth by uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance. If you're uploading over a spotty network, use multipart uploading to increase resiliency to network errors by avoiding upload restarts.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upload the compressed file in a single operation</strong> - In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation. Multipart upload provides improved throughput - you can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput. Therefore, this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upload the compressed file using multipart upload</strong> - Although using multipart upload would certainly speed up the process, combining with S3 transfer acceleration would further improve the transfer speed. Therefore just using multipart upload is not the correct option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FTP the compressed file into an EC2 instance that runs in the same region as the S3 bucket. Then transfer the file from the EC2 instance into the S3 bucket</strong> -  This is a roundabout process of getting the file into S3 and added as a distractor. Although it is technically feasible to follow this process, it would involve a lot of scripting and certainly would not be the fastest way to get the file into S3.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html</a></p>\n",
