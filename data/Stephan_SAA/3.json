Amazon SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using Amazon SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.</p>\n\n<p>By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second) without batching. Therefore, using batching you can meet a throughput requirement of upto 3,000 messages per second.</p>\n\n<p>The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix.

AWS Database Migration Service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.</p>\n\n<p>Given the use-case where the CTO at the company wants to move away from license-based, expensive, legacy commercial database solutions deployed at the on-premises data center to more efficient, open-source, and cost-effective options on AWS Cloud, this is an example of heterogeneous database migrations.</p>\n\n<p>For such a scenario, the source and target databases engines are different, like in the case of Oracle to Amazon Aurora, Oracle to PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL migrations. In this case, the schema structure, data types, and database code of source and target databases can be quite different, requiring a schema and code transformation before the data migration starts.</p>\n\n<p>That makes heterogeneous migrations a two-step process. First use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the source schema and code to match that of the target database, and then use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database. All the required data type conversions will automatically be done by the AWS Database Migration Service during the migration. The source database can be located on your on-premises environment outside of AWS, running on an Amazon EC2 instance, or it can be an Amazon RDS database.

You want both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.</p>\n\n<p>KDS provides the ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt4-q6-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/faqs/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you’re already using today. It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. As Kinesis Data Firehose is used to load streaming data into data stores, therefore this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics</strong> - Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to analyze streaming data in real-time.  You can quickly build SQL queries and sophisticated Java applications using built-in templates and operators for common processing functions to organize, transform, aggregate, and analyze data at any scale. Kinesis Data Analytics enables you to easily and quickly build queries and sophisticated streaming applications in three simple steps: setup your streaming data sources, write your queries or streaming applications and set up your destination for processed data. As Kinesis Data Analytics is used to build SQL queries and sophisticated Java applications, therefore this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)</strong> - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. Amazon SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent. For SQS, you cannot have the same message being consumed by multiple consumers at the same time, therefore this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Exam alert:</p>\n\n<p>Please remember that Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is used to load streaming data into data stores (Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk) whereas Kinesis Data Streams provides support for real-time processing of streaming data. It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple downstream Amazon Kinesis Applications.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/faqs/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/faqs/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/faqs/</a></p>\n",

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use VPC endpoint to access Amazon SQS</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS customers can access Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) using VPC endpoints, without using public IPs, and without needing to traverse the public internet. VPC endpoints for Amazon SQS are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a highly available, scalable technology that enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon VPC endpoints are easy to configure. They also provide reliable connectivity to Amazon SQS without requiring an internet gateway, Network Address Translation (NAT) instance, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. With VPC endpoints, the data between your Amazon VPC and Amazon SQS queue is transferred within the Amazon network, helping protect your instances from internet traffic.</p>\n\n<p>AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating the exposure of data to the public Internet. AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely on the Amazon network. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify the network architecture.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Internet Gateway to access Amazon SQS</strong> - An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. This option is ruled out as the team does not want to use the public internet to access Amazon SQS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use VPN connection to access Amazon SQS</strong> - AWS Site-to-Site VPN (aka VPN Connection) enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity. As the existing infrastructure is within AWS Cloud, therefore a VPN connection is not required.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Network Address Translation (NAT) instance to access Amazon SQS</strong> - You can use a network address translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the Internet. Amazon provides Amazon Linux AMIs that are configured to run as NAT instances. These AMIs include the string amzn-ami-vpc-nat in their names, so you can search for them in the Amazon EC2 console. This option is ruled out because NAT instances are used to provide internet access to any instances in a private subnet.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/\">https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/12/amazon-sqs-vpc-endpoints-aws-privatelink/\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/12/amazon-sqs-vpc-endpoints-aws-privatelink/</a></p>\n",

AWS Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure, and manage. It provides static IP addresses that provide a fixed entry point to your applications and eliminate the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones (AZs). AWS Global Accelerator always routes user traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance, reacting instantly to changes in application health, your user’s location, and policies that you configure. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP. Therefore, this option is correct.</p>\n\n<p>How AWS Global Accelerator Works:\n<img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/r2018/b/ubiquity/global-accelerator-how-it-works.feb297eb78d8cc55205874a1691e0ea2bc8bdbf1.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/\">https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon CloudFront to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results</strong> - Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure that popular content can be served quickly to your viewers. Amazon CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your viewers, even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP, to help improve performance for that content. Regional edge caches help with all types of content, particularly content that tends to become less popular over time. Examples include user-generated content, such as video, photos, or artwork; e-commerce assets such as product photos and videos; and news and event-related content that might suddenly find new popularity. CloudFront supports HTTP/RTMP protocol based requests, therefore this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results</strong> - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and AWS Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancer cannot help with decreasing latency of incoming traffic from the source.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Auto Scaling group to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results</strong> - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of Amazon EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. Auto Scaling group cannot help with decreasing latency of incoming traffic from the source.</p>\n\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n\n<p>Please note the differences between the capabilities of AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront -</p>\n\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. Amazon CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). AWS Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/\">https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/faqs/</a></p>\n",

Amazon SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. Amazon SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.</p>\n\n<p>Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for several seconds, for example, when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages. If you create a delay queue, any messages that you send to the queue remain invisible to consumers for the duration of the delay period. The default (minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds.

You cannot use dead-letter queues to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use visibility timeout to postpone the delivery of new messages to the queue for a few seconds</strong> - Visibility timeout is a period during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing a given message.

Amazon SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work.

Amazon SQS lets you decouple application components so that they run and fail independently, increasing the overall fault tolerance of the system. Multiple copies of every message are stored redundantly across multiple availability zones so that they are available whenever needed.

This is an important difference between Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS. Whereas Amazon SQS is a polling mechanism, that gives applications the chance to poll at their own comfort, the push mechanism assumes the other applications are present.

First, you don’t need to plan for and allocate a specific amount of storage space because Amazon S3 buckets scale automatically. As Amazon S3 is a serverless service, you don’t need to manage or patch servers that store files yourself; you just put and get your content. Finally, even if you require a server for your application (for example, because you have a dynamic application), the server can be smaller because it doesn’t have to handle requests for static content.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of Amazon CloudFront can be more cost-effective than delivering it from Amazon S3 directly to your users. Amazon CloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations. Using edge servers to cache and serve content improves performance by providing content closer to where viewers are located.</p>\n\n<p>When a user requests content that you serve with Amazon CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location. If Amazon CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront retrieves it from your origin – for example, the Amazon S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content. Then, for the next local request for the same content, it’s already cached nearby and can be served immediately.</p>\n\n<p>By caching your content in Edge Locations, Amazon CloudFront reduces the load on your Amazon S3 bucket and helps ensure a faster response for your users when they request content. Also, data transfer out for content by using Amazon CloudFront is often more cost-effective than serving files directly from Amazon S3, and there is no data transfer fee from Amazon S3 to Amazon CloudFront. You only pay for what is delivered to the internet from Amazon CloudFront, plus request fees.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure AWS Lambda with an Amazon RDS database to provide a serverless architecture</strong> - Amazon RDS is not the right choice for the current scenario because of the overhead of a database management system, as the given use-case can be addressed by using Amazon S3 storage solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon CloudFront with Amazon DynamoDB for greater speed and low latency access to static assets</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. But, Amazon DynamoDB is overkill for the given use-case and will prove to be a very costly solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Lambda with Amazon ElastiCache and Amazon RDS for serving static assets at high speed and low latency</strong> - As discussed above, Amazon RDS is not needed for this use case where web application needs to display static pages and facilitate downloads of historic data.

It is built on Windows Server, delivering a wide range of administrative features such as user quotas, end-user file restore, and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) integration. It offers single-AZ and multi-AZ deployment options, fully managed backups, and encryption of data at rest and in transit. You can optimize cost and performance for your workload needs with SSD and HDD storage options; and you can scale storage and change the throughput performance of your file system at any time.</p>\n\n<p>With Amazon FSx, you get highly available and durable file storage starting from $0.013 per GB-month. Data deduplication enables you to optimize costs even further by removing redundant data. You can increase your file system storage and scale throughput capacity at any time, making it easy to respond to changing business needs.

Many workloads such as machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), video rendering, and financial simulations depend on compute instances accessing the same set of data through high-performance shared storage. Lustre is Linux based, hence it is not the right choice since the use case is about Windows-based applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) as a shared storage solution</strong> - Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

But to help optimize your application’s performance and security while effectively managing cost, AWS recommends that you also set up Amazon CloudFront to work with your Amazon S3 bucket to serve and protect the content.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of Amazon CloudFront can be more cost-effective than delivering it from Amazon S3 directly to your users.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon CloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations. Using edge servers to cache and serve content improves performance by providing content closer to where viewers are located. Amazon CloudFront has edge servers in locations all around the world.</p>\n\n<p>When a user requests content that you serve with Amazon CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location. If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, Amazon CloudFront retrieves it from your origin – for example, the S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content. Then, for the next local request for the same content, it’s already cached nearby and can be served immediately.</p>\n\n<p>By caching your content in Edge Locations, Amazon CloudFront reduces the load on your Amazon S3 bucket and helps ensure a faster response for your users when they request content. Also, data transfer out for content by using CloudFront is often more cost-effective than serving files directly from Amazon S3, and there is no data transfer fee from Amazon S3 to CloudFront. You only pay for what is delivered to the internet from Amazon CloudFront, plus request fees.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>To reduce Amazon S3 cost, the data can be saved on an Amazon EBS volume connected to an Amazon EC2 instance that can host the application</strong> - Amazon EBS volumes are fast and are relatively cheap (though Amazon S3 is still a cheaper alternative). But, Amazon EBS volumes are accessible only through Amazon EC2 instances and are bound to a specific region.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon EFS service, as it provides a shared, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for storing AWS Cloud or on-premises data</strong> - Amazon EFS is a shareable file system that can be mounted onto Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EFS is costlier than Amazon EBS and not a solution if the company is looking at reducing costs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure Amazon S3 Batch Operations to read data in bulk at one go, to reduce the number of calls made to Amazon S3 buckets</strong> - This statement is incorrect and given only as a distractor.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB point in time recovery to restore the table to the state just before corrupted data was written</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amazon DynamoDB enables you to back up your table data continuously by using point-in-time recovery (PITR). When you enable PITR, DynamoDB backs up your table data automatically with per-second granularity so that you can restore to any given second in the preceding 35 days.</p>\n\n<p>PITR helps protect you against accidental writes and deletes. For example, if a test script writes accidentally to a production DynamoDB table or someone mistakenly issues a \"DeleteItem\" call, PITR has you covered.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB on-demand backup to restore the table to the state just before corrupted data was written</strong> - The on-demand backup and restore process scales without degrading the performance or availability of your applications. It uses a new and unique distributed technology that lets you complete backups in seconds regardless of table size. You can create backups that are consistent within seconds across thousands of partitions without worrying about schedules or long-running backup processes. All on-demand backups are cataloged, discoverable, and retained until they are explicitly deleted.</p>\n\n<p>On-demand backup is created upon request. So this option is not correct since an on-demand backup cannot be created pre-emptively to handle data corruption issues that happen once in a while.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure the Amazon DynamoDB table as a global table and point the application to use the table from another AWS region that has no corrupted data</strong> - Global tables build on the global Amazon DynamoDB footprint to provide you with a fully managed, multi-Region, and multi-active database that delivers fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications.</p>\n\n<p>Global tables eliminate the difficult work of replicating data between Regions and resolving update conflicts, enabling you to focus on your application's business logic. In addition, global tables enable your applications to stay highly available even in the unlikely event of isolation or degradation of an entire Region.</p>\n\n<p>Any changes made to any item in any replica table are replicated to all the other replicas within the same global table. In a global table, a newly written item is usually propagated to all replica tables within a second. With a global table, each replica table stores the same set of data items. Amazon DynamoDB does not support partial replication of only some of the items. If applications update the same item in different Regions at about the same time, conflicts can arise. To help ensure eventual consistency, Amazon DynamoDB global tables use a last-writer-wins reconciliation between concurrent updates, in which DynamoDB makes its best effort to determine the last writer. With this conflict resolution mechanism, all replicas agree on the latest update and converge toward a state in which they all have identical data.</p>\n\n<p>Global tables replicate your Amazon DynamoDB tables automatically across your choice of AWS Regions. This option has been added as a distractor since you cannot point the application to use the table from another AWS region, since there is no \"other\" table in another region. It's just a single logical Global table.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB Streams to restore the table to the state just before corrupted data was written</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any Amazon DynamoDB table and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours. Applications can access this log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in near-real time. A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a Amazon DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the table.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon DynamoDB Streams writes stream records in near-real time so that you can build applications that consume these streams and take action based on the contents. It will take considerable effort and custom coding to reliably rebuild table data to the state just before any corrupted data was written. So this option is not the best fit.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/BackupRestore.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/BackupRestore.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/PointInTimeRecovery_Howitworks.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/PointInTimeRecovery_Howitworks.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/\">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html</a></p>\n",

You may use an existing CloudWatch Amazon SQS metric like ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible for target tracking but you could still face an issue so that the number of messages in the queue might not change proportionally to the size of the Auto Scaling group that processes messages from the queue. The solution is to use a backlog per instance metric with the target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>To calculate your backlog per instance, divide the ApproximateNumberOfMessages queue attribute by the number of instances in the InService state for the Auto Scaling group. Then set a target value for the Acceptable backlog per instance.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate with an example, let's say that the current ApproximateNumberOfMessages is 1500 and the fleet's running capacity is 10. If the average processing time is 0.1 seconds for each message and the longest acceptable latency is 10 seconds, then the acceptable backlog per instance is 10 / 0.1, which equals 100. This means that 100 is the target value for your target tracking policy. If the backlog per instance is currently at 150 (1500 / 10), your fleet scales out, and it scales out by five instances to maintain proportion to the target value.</p>\n\n<p>Scaling Based on Amazon SQS:\n<img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/sqs-as-custom-metric-diagram.png\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use a simple scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric</strong> - With simple scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the Amazon CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process. The main issue with simple scaling is that after a scaling activity is started, the policy must wait for the scaling activity or health check replacement to complete and the cooldown period to expire before responding to additional alarms. This implies that the application would not be able to react quickly to sudden spikes in orders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use a step scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric</strong> - With step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the Amazon CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process. When step adjustments are applied, they increase or decrease the current capacity of your Auto Scaling group, and the adjustments vary based on the size of the alarm breach. For the given use-case, step scaling would try to approximate the correct number of instances by increasing/decreasing the steps as per the policy. This is not as efficient as the target tracking policy where you can calculate the exact number of instances required to handle the spike in orders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use a scheduled scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric</strong> - Scheduled scaling allows you to set your scaling schedule. For example, let's say that every week the traffic to your web application starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday. You can plan your scaling actions based on the predictable traffic patterns of your web application. Scaling actions are performed automatically as a function of time and date.

By using an Aurora global database, you can plan for and recover from disaster fairly quickly. Recovery from disaster is typically measured using values for RTO and RPO.</p>\n\n<p>Recovery time objective (RTO) – The time it takes a system to return to a working state after a disaster. In other words, RTO measures downtime. For an Aurora global database, RTO can be in the order of minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Recovery point objective (RPO) – The amount of data that can be lost (measured in time). For an Aurora global database, RPO is typically measured in seconds.</p>\n\n<p>With an Aurora global database, you can choose from two different approaches to failover:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Managed planned failover – This feature is intended for controlled environments, such as disaster recovery (DR) testing scenarios, operational maintenance, and other planned operational procedures. Managed planned failover allows you to relocate the primary DB cluster of your Aurora global database to one of the secondary Regions. Because this feature synchronizes secondary DB clusters with the primary before making any other changes, RPO is 0 (no data loss).</p></li>\n<li><p>Unplanned failover (\"detach and promote\") – To recover from an unplanned outage, you can perform a cross-Region failover to one of the secondaries in your Aurora global database. The RTO for this manual process depends on how quickly you can perform the tasks listed in Recovering an Amazon Aurora global database from an unplanned outage. The RPO is typically measured in seconds, but this depends on the Aurora storage replication lag across the network at the time of the failure.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Disaster Recovery in Aurora Global Databases:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt4-q61-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision Amazon RDS for MySQL with a cross-Region read replica</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with a cross-Region read replica</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database (DB) instances. They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. For a failover, read replicas have to be manually promoted to a standalone database instance since the process is not automatic. Hence, the RTO will be quite high, so both these options are not correct for this use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provision Amazon DynamoDB global tables</strong> - Aurora Global Database is good for applications that need to support cross-Region reads with low latency updates and the ability to quickly failover between regions. DynamoDB global tables provide cross-region active-active capabilities with high performance, but you lose some of the data access flexibility that comes with SQL-based databases. Due to the active-active configuration of DynamoDB global tables, there is no concept of failover because the application writes to the table in its region, and then the data is replicated to keep the other regions' table in sync. DynamoDB global tables is a much costlier solution than Aurora Global Database for the given requirement.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-failover\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-failover</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/how-to-use-amazon-dynamodb-global-tables-to-power-multiregion-architectures/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/how-to-use-amazon-dynamodb-global-tables-to-power-multiregion-architectures/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database.html</a></p>\n",

Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. Running a DB instance with high availability can enhance availability during planned system maintenance, and help protect your databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone disruption. In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of your DB instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have enabled Multi-AZ.

The source DB instance becomes the primary DB instance. Updates made to the primary DB instance are asynchronously copied to the read replica.

Using read replicas, you can elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.</p>\n\n<p>Both these options talk about creating a read replica that <strong>synchronously</strong> replicates the data, but in reality, any updates made to the primary DB instance are <strong>asynchronously</strong> copied to the read replica.
