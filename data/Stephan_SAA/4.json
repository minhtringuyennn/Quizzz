This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.</p>\n\n<p>Instance store volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost.

Your applications can easily achieve thousands of transactions per second in request performance when uploading and retrieving storage from Amazon S3.</p>\n\n<p>Instance Store will have the highest disk performance but you would lose the storage if the instance is terminated, which is acceptable in this case. Amazon EBS volumes would provide good performance as far as disk goes, but not as good as Instance Store. Amazon EBS data survives instance termination or reboots.

The development team has updated the Amazon Route 53 simple record to point \"myapp.mydomain.com\" from the old Load Balancer to the new one.</p>\n\n<p>The users are still not redirected to the new Load Balancer. What has gone wrong in the configuration?</p>\n",
        "relatedLectureIds": "",
        "feedbacks": ["", "", "", ""],
        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p>Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS – such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets – and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.</p>\n\n<p>You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes it easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based Routing, Geo DNS, Geoproximity, and Weighted Round Robin—all of which can be combined with DNS Failover to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Time To Live (TTL) is still in effect</strong></p>\n\n<p>TTL (time to live), is the amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS recursive resolvers to cache information about a record. If you specify a longer value (for example, 172800 seconds, or two days), you reduce the number of calls that DNS recursive resolvers must make to Amazon Route 53 to get the latest information for the record. This has the effect of reducing latency and reducing your bill for Route 53 service.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you specify a longer value for TTL, it takes longer for changes to the record (for example, a new IP address) to take effect because recursive resolvers use the values in their cache for longer periods before they ask Route 53 for the latest information. If you're changing settings for a domain or subdomain that's already in use, AWS recommends that you initially specify a shorter value, such as 300 seconds, and increase the value after you confirm that the new settings are correct.</p>\n\n<p>For this use-case, the most likely issue is that the TTL is still in effect so you have to wait until it expires for the new request to perform another DNS query and get the value for the new Load Balancer.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The CNAME Record is misconfigured</strong> - A CNAME record can redirect DNS queries to any DNS record. For example, you can create a CNAME record that redirects queries from acme.example.com to zenith.example.com or to acme.example.org. You don't need to use Amazon Route 53 as the DNS service for the domain that you're redirecting queries to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Alias Record is misconfigured</strong> - Amazon Route 53 also offers alias records, which are an Amazon Route 53-specific extension to DNS. Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources, such as Amazon CloudFront distributions and Amazon S3 buckets. They also let you route traffic from one record in a hosted zone to another record.\nUnlike a CNAME record, you can create an alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace, also known as the zone apex. For example, if you register the DNS name example.com, the zone apex is example.com. You can't create a CNAME record for example.com, but you can create an alias record for example.com that routes traffic to www.example.com.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The health checks are failing</strong> - Simple Records do not have health checks, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/route53/\">https://aws.amazon.com/route53/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-basic.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-basic.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html</a></p>\n",

Amazon SNS provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. Amazon SNS is a notification service and will be perfect for this use case.</p>\n\n<p>Streaming data with Amazon Kinesis and using Amazon SNS to send the response notifications is the optimal solution for the current scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) with Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</strong> - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. Kinesis is better for streaming data since queues aren't meant for real-time streaming of data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)</strong> - Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cloud-based email sending service designed to help digital marketers and application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. It is a reliable, cost-effective service for businesses of all sizes that use email to keep in contact with their customers. It is an email service and not a notification service as is the requirement in the current use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)</strong> - As explained above, Amazon Kinesis works well for streaming real-time data. Amazon SQS is a queuing service that helps decouple system architecture by offering flexibility and ease of maintenance. It cannot send notifications.

You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you need instances with different configurations.</p>\n\n<p>For the current use case, you need to create an AMI such that the application stack is already set up. But AMIs are bound to the Region they are created in. So, you need to copy the AMI across Regions for disaster recovery readiness.</p>\n\n<p>Copying a source AMI results in an identical but distinct target AMI with its own unique identifier. In the case of an Amazon EBS-backed AMI, each of its backing snapshots is, by default, copied to an identical but distinct target snapshot. (The sole exceptions are when you choose to encrypt or re-encrypt the snapshot.) You can change or deregister the source AMI with no effect on the target AMI. The reverse is also true.\nThere are no charges for copying an AMI. However, standard storage and data transfer rates apply.

With AWS CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. AWS CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.</p>\n\n<p>In general, to analyze any API calls made within an AWS account, AWS CloudTrail is used. You can record the actions that are taken by users, roles, or AWS services on Amazon S3 resources and maintain log records for auditing and compliance purposes. To do this, you can use server access logging, AWS CloudTrail logging, or a combination of both. AWS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Amazon S3 resources.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implement an IAM policy to forbid users to change Amazon S3 bucket settings</strong> - You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP), access control list (ACL), and session policies.</p>\n\n<p>Implementing an IAM policy to forbid users would be disruptive and wouldn't go unnoticed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon S3 access logs to analyze user access using Athena</strong> - Amazon S3 server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. Server access logs are useful for many applications. For example, access log information can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill. AWS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Amazon S3 resources, as it provides more options to store, analyze and act on the log information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Implement a bucket policy requiring AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) for all operations</strong> - Amazon S3 supports MFA-protected API access, a feature that can enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to your Amazon S3 resources.

Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones (AZs) that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region. The DB cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of the data for the DB cluster. However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical volume to the primary instance and Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.

In this way, Aurora Read Replicas can be deployed globally.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Aurora Multi-AZ</strong> - Aurora, stores copies of the data in a DB cluster across multiple Availability Zones in a single AWS Region, regardless of whether the instances in the DB cluster span multiple Availability Zones (AZs). When data is written to the primary DB instance, Aurora synchronously replicates the data across Availability Zones (AZs) to six storage nodes associated with your cluster volume. Doing so provides data redundancy, eliminates I/O freezes, and minimizes latency spikes during system backups.

They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB Instance and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput. Read replicas can also be promoted when needed to become standalone DB instances.</p>\n\n<p>More on Amazon RDS Read Replicas:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q13-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon RDS Multi-AZ feature</strong> - Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability for RDS database (DB) instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon ElastiCache</strong> - Amazon ElastiCache allows you to seamlessly set up, run, and scale popular open-Source compatible in-memory data stores in the cloud. Build data-intensive apps or boost the performance of your existing databases by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores, Gaming, Geospatial Services, Real-Time Analytics, and Queuing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use multi-part upload feature of Amazon S3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Multi-part upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object.</p>\n\n<p>AWS recommends that you use multi-part uploading in the following ways:\n1. If you're uploading large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use multi-part uploading to maximize the use of your available bandwidth by uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance.\n2. If you're uploading over a spotty network, use multi-part uploading to increase resiliency to network errors by avoiding upload restarts. When using multi-part uploading, you need to retry uploading only parts that are interrupted during the upload. You don't need to restart uploading your object from the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>In general, when your object size reaches 100 megabytes, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation. If the file is greater than 5 gigabytes in size, you must use multi-part upload to upload that file to Amazon S3.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Amazon S3 Versioning</strong> - Amazon S3 Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects. If you overwrite an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. You can always restore the previous version.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Direct Connect to provide extra bandwidth</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. This dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs. This is a physical connection that takes at least a month to set up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Snowball</strong> - AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80 terabytes of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 gigabytes network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.</p>\n\n<p>(The original AWS Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer. You may see the Snowball device on the exam, just remember that the original AWS Snowball device had 80 terabytes of storage space).</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html</a></p>\n",

The following diagram shows the high-level connectivity with virtual private gateways.</p>\n\n<p>With AWS Transit Gateway, you can simplify the connectivity between multiple VPCs and also connect to any VPC attached to AWS Transit Gateway with a single VPN connection. AWS Transit Gateway also enables you to scale the IPsec VPN throughput with equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing support over multiple VPN tunnels. A single VPN tunnel still has a maximum throughput of 1.25 Gbps. If you establish multiple VPN tunnels to an ECMP-enabled transit gateway, it can scale beyond the default maximum limit of 1.25 Gbps.  You also must enable the dynamic routing option on your transit gateway to be able to take advantage of ECMP for scalability.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q18-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/transit-gateway-ecmp-multiple-tunnels/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/transit-gateway-ecmp-multiple-tunnels/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Transfer Acceleration for the VPN connection to maximize the throughput</strong> - Transfer Acceleration is an Amazon S3 bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration is designed to optimize transfer speeds from across the world into S3 buckets. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of the globally distributed edge locations in Amazon CloudFront.</p>\n\n<p>This option has been added as a distractor as it is not relevant to AWS VPN connections.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Global Accelerator for the VPN connection to maximize the throughput</strong> - AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the performance of your users’ traffic by up to 60% using the global network infrastructure of AWS. When the internet is congested, AWS Global Accelerator optimizes the path to your application to keep packet loss, jitter, and latency consistently low. With Global Accelerator, you are provided two global static public IPs that act as a fixed entry point to your application, improving availability. Global Accelerator automatically re-routes your traffic to your nearest healthy available endpoint to mitigate endpoint failure.</p>\n\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator can be used to optimize the network path, using the congestion-free AWS global network to route traffic to the endpoint that provides the best application performance . You can use an accelerated VPN connection to avoid network disruptions that might occur when traffic is routed over the public internet. AWS Global Accelerator will not maximize the VPN throughput, so it is not the best fit for the given use case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a virtual private gateway with equal cost multipath routing and multiple channels</strong> - A virtual private gateway is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of your Site-to-Site VPN connection that can be attached to a single VPC. A virtual private gateway does not support equal cost multi-path (ECMP) routing, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/transit-gateway-ecmp-multiple-tunnels/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/transit-gateway-ecmp-multiple-tunnels/</a></p>\n",

You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:</p>\n\n<p>Cluster – packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone (AZ). This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications.</p>\n\n<p>Partition – spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.</p>\n\n<p>Spread – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.</p>\n\n<p>There is no charge for creating a placement group.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use a Cluster placement group</strong></p>\n\n<p>A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone (AZ). A cluster placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Region. Instances in the same cluster placement group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit of up to 10 Gbps for TCP/IP traffic and are placed in the same high-bisection bandwidth segment of the network.</p>\n\n<p>Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both. They are also recommended when the majority of the network traffic is between the instances in the group.

        "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pilot Light</strong></p>\n\n<p>The term pilot light is often used to describe a DR scenario in which a minimal version of an environment is always running in the cloud. The idea of the pilot light is an analogy that comes from the gas heater. In a gas heater, a small flame that’s always on can quickly ignite the entire furnace to heat up a house. This scenario is similar to a backup-and-restore scenario. For example, with AWS you can maintain a pilot light by configuring and running the most critical core elements of your system in AWS. For the given use-case, a small part of the backup infrastructure is always running simultaneously syncing mutable data (such as databases or documents) so that there is no loss of critical data. When the time comes for recovery, you can rapidly provision a full-scale production environment around the critical core. For Pilot light, RPO/RTO is in 10s of minutes, so this is the correct solution.</p>\n\n<p>Four Disaster Recovery scenarios:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q24-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backup and Restore</strong> - In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and sent off-site regularly. If you use this method, it can take a long time to restore your system in the event of a disruption or disaster. Amazon S3 is an ideal destination for backup data that might be needed quickly to perform a restore. Transferring data to and from Amazon S3 is typically done through the network and is therefore accessible from any location. There are many commercial and open-source backup solutions that integrate with Amazon S3. You can use AWS Import/Export to transfer very large data sets by shipping storage devices directly to AWS. For longer-term data storage where retrieval times of several hours are adequate, there is Amazon Glacier, which has the same durability model as Amazon S3. Amazon Glacier is a low-cost alternative starting from $0.01/GB per month. Amazon Glacier and Amazon S3 can be used in conjunction to produce a tiered backup solution. Even though Backup and Restore method is cheaper, it has an RPO in hours, so this option is not the right fit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warm Standby</strong> - The term warm standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud. A warm standby solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation. It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running. By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on. This option is costlier compared to Pilot Light.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multi-Site</strong> - A multi-site solution runs on AWS as well as on your existing on-site infrastructure in an active-active configuration. The data replication method that you employ will be determined by the recovery point that you choose, either Recovery Time Objective (the maximum allowable downtime before degraded operations are restored) or Recovery Point Objective (the maximum allowable time window whereby you will accept the loss of transactions during the DR process). This option is more costly compared to Pilot Light.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/rapidly-recover-mission-critical-systems-in-a-disaster/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/rapidly-recover-mission-critical-systems-in-a-disaster/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html</a></p>\n",

The sync command lists the source and target buckets to identify objects that are in the source bucket but that aren't in the target bucket. The command also identifies objects in the source bucket that have different LastModified dates than the objects that are in the target bucket. The sync command on a versioned bucket copies only the current version of the object—previous versions aren't copied. By default, this preserves object metadata, but the access control lists (ACLs) are set to FULL_CONTROL for your AWS account, which removes any additional ACLs. If the operation fails, you can run the sync command again without duplicating previously copied objects.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the command like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>aws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGET</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon S3 batch replication to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in another Region using S3 console and then delete the replication configuration</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Batch Replication provides you a way to replicate objects that existed before a replication configuration was in place, objects that have previously been replicated, and objects that have failed replication. This is done through the use of a Batch Operations job.</p>\n\n<p>You should note that batch replication differs from live replication which continuously and automatically replicates new objects across Amazon S3 buckets. You cannot directly use the AWS S3 console to configure cross-Region replication for existing objects. By default, replication only supports copying new Amazon S3 objects after it is enabled using the AWS S3 console. Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. Object may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. Destination buckets can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket. Once done, you can delete the replication configuration, as it ensures that batch replication is only used for this one-time data copy operation.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to enable live replication for existing objects for your bucket, you must contact AWS Support and raise a support ticket. This is required to ensure that replication is configured correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use AWS Snowball Edge device to copy the data from one Region to another Region</strong> - As the given requirement is about copying the data from one AWS Region to another AWS Region, so AWS Snowball Edge cannot be used here. AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal data transfer choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. You can use AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized if you have a large backlog of data to transfer or if you frequently collect data that needs to be transferred to AWS and your storage is in an area where high-bandwidth internet connections are not available or cost-prohibitive. AWS Snowball Edge can operate in remote locations or harsh operating environments, such as factory floors, oil and gas rigs, mining sites, hospitals, and on moving vehicles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Copy data from the source Amazon S3 bucket to a target Amazon S3 bucket using the S3 console</strong> - AWS S3 console cannot be used to copy 1 petabytes of data from one bucket to another as it's not feasible. You should note that this option is different from using the replication options on the AWS console, since here you are using the copy and paste options provided on the AWS console, which is suggested for small or medium data volume. You should use S3 sync for the requirement of one-time copy of data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different Regions using S3 console</strong> - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an Amazon S3 bucket.

An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses. An internet gateway supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.</p>\n\n<p>To enable access to or from the internet for instances in a subnet in a VPC, you must do the following:\n    1. Attach an internet gateway to your VPC.\n    2. Add a route to your subnet's route table that directs internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway.\n    3. Ensure that instances in your subnet have a globally unique IP address\n    4. Ensure that your network access control lists and security group rules allow the relevant traffic to flow to and from your instance.</p>\n\n<p>A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed. After creating an IGW, make sure the route tables are updated. Additionally, ensure the security group allows the ICMP protocol for ping requests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check if the security groups allow ping from the source</strong></p>\n\n<p>A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. When you launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups; otherwise, AWS uses the default security group. You can add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group. To decide whether to allow traffic to reach an instance, all the rules from all the security groups that are associated with the instance are evaluated.</p>\n\n<p>The following are the characteristics of security group rules:\n    1. By default, security groups allow all outbound traffic.\n    2. Security group rules are always permissive; you can't create rules that deny access.\n    3. Security groups are stateful</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disable Source / Destination check on the Amazon EC2 instance</strong> - The Source/Destination Check attribute controls whether source/destination checking is enabled on the instance. Disabling this attribute enables an instance to handle network traffic that isn't specifically destined for the instance. For example, instances running services such as network address translation, routing, or a firewall should set this value to disabled. The default value is enabled. Source/Destination Check is not relevant to the question and it has been added as a distractor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a secondary internet gateway to attach with public subnet and move the current internet gateway to private and write route tables</strong> - There is no such thing as a secondary IGW.

A warm standby solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation. It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running. By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them always on.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backup and Restore</strong> - In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and sent off-site regularly. If you use this method, it can take a long time to restore your system in the event of a disruption or disaster. Amazon S3 is an ideal destination for backup data that might be needed quickly to perform a restore. Transferring data to and from Amazon S3 is typically done through the network, and is therefore accessible from any location. Many commercial and open-source backup solutions integrate with Amazon S3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pilot Light</strong> - The term pilot light is often used to describe a DR scenario in which a minimal version of an environment is always running in the cloud. The idea of the pilot light is an analogy that comes from the gas heater. In a gas heater, a small flame that’s always on can quickly ignite the entire furnace to heat up a house. This scenario is similar to a backup-and-restore scenario. For example, with AWS you can maintain a pilot light by configuring and running the most critical core elements of your system in AWS. When the time comes for recovery, you can rapidly provision a full-scale production environment around the critical core.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multi Site</strong> - A multi-site solution runs in AWS as well as on your existing on-site infrastructure, in an active-active configuration.

An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of actions:</p>\n\n<p>Transition actions — Define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after you created them, or archive objects to the S3 Glacier storage class one year after creating them.</p>\n\n<p>Expiration actions — Define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a Lifecycle Policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 Standard IA using a prefix after 45 days</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amazon S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Amazon S3 Standard-IA offers high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per gigabyte storage price and per gigabyte retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance makes Amazon S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.

Glacier doesn't need prefixes for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a Lifecycle Policy to transition objects to Amazon S3 One Zone IA using a prefix after 45 days</strong> - Amazon S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Amazon S3 Standard-IA offers high durability, high throughput, and low latency of Amazon S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance makes S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.

APIs act as the \"front door\" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.</p>\n\n<p>You can enable Amazon API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoint's responses. With caching, you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your API.\nWhen you enable caching for a stage, API Gateway caches responses from your endpoint for a specified time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds. Amazon API Gateway then responds to the request by looking up the endpoint response from the cache instead of requesting your endpoint. The default TTL value for API caching is 300 seconds. The maximum TTL value is 3600 seconds. TTL=0 means caching is disabled. Using API Gateway Caching feature is the answer for the use case, as we can accept stale data for about 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Add Amazon Aurora Read Replicas</strong> - Amazon Aurora features a distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 64TB per database instance. It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).</p>\n\n<p>Amazon Aurora Read Replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations and increasing availability. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region. The DB cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of the data for the DB cluster. However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical volume to the primary instance and to Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. Adding Aurora Read Replicas would greatly increase the cost, therefore this option is ruled out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Switch to using an Application Load Balancer</strong> - An Application Load Balancer functions at the application layer, the seventh layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. After the load balancer receives a request, it evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects a target from the target group for the rule action. You can configure listener rules to route requests to different target groups based on the content of the application traffic. Switching to a Load Balancer would not improve the current status as we need a caching mechanism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enable AWS Lambda In Memory Caching</strong> - AWS Lambda has no native in-memory caching capability. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute capacity. This option is incorrect and has been added as a distractor.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-caching.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-caching.html</a></p>\n",

Using Direct Connect as a backup solution would work but probably carries a risk it would fail as well.

For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer in the Frankfurt region.</p>\n\n<p>When you use geolocation routing, you can localize your content and present some or all of your website in the language of your users. You can also use geolocation routing to restrict the distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights. Another possible use is for balancing load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way so that each user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Latency-based routing</strong> - If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency.</p>\n\n<p>To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions. When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain (example.com or acme.example.com), it determines which AWS Regions you've created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Amazon Route 53 responds with the value from the selected record, such as the IP address for a web server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weighted routing</strong> - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of software.</p>\n\n<p>To configure weighted routing, you create records that have the same name and type for each of your resources. You assign each record a relative weight that corresponds with how much traffic you want to send to each resource.

DynamoDB on-demand offers pay-per-request pricing for read and write requests so that you pay only for what you use.</p>\n\n<p>The on-demand mode is a good option if any of the following are true:</p>\n\n<p>You create new tables with unknown workloads.</p>\n\n<p>You have unpredictable application traffic.</p>\n\n<p>You prefer the ease of paying for only what you use.</p>\n\n<p>If you choose provisioned mode, you specify the number of reads and writes per second that you require for your application. You can use auto-scaling to adjust your table’s provisioned capacity automatically in response to traffic changes. This helps you govern your DynamoDB use to stay at or below a defined request rate to obtain cost predictability.</p>\n\n<p>Provisioned mode is a good option if any of the following are true:</p>\n\n<p>You have predictable application traffic.</p>\n\n<p>You run applications whose traffic is consistent or ramps gradually.</p>\n\n<p>You can forecast capacity requirements to control costs.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q62-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-dynamodb-auto-scaling-performance-and-cost-optimization-at-any-scale/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-dynamodb-auto-scaling-performance-and-cost-optimization-at-any-scale/</a></p>\n\n<p>With on-demand, Amazon DynamoDB instantly allocates capacity as it is needed. There is no concept of provisioned capacity, and there is no delay waiting for Amazon CloudWatch thresholds or the subsequent table updates. On-demand is ideal for bursty, new, or unpredictable workloads whose traffic can spike in seconds or minutes, and when underprovisioned capacity would impact the user experience. On-demand is a perfect solution if your team is moving to a NoOps or serverless environment.</p>\n\n<p>The given use case clearly states that when the traffic spikes occur they happen very quickly, thereby implying an unpredictable traffic pattern, therefore the on-demand capacity mode is the correct option for the given use case.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon DynamoDB table in the provisioned capacity mode with auto-scaling enabled</strong> - As mentioned in the explanation above, you should use the provisioned capacity mode (even with auto-scaling) only when you have predictable application traffic.</p>\n\n<p>When you create Amazon DynamoDB table, auto-scaling is the default capacity setting, but you can also enable auto-scaling on any table that does not have it active. Behind the scenes, as illustrated in the following diagram, DynamoDB auto scaling uses a scaling policy in Application Auto Scaling. To configure auto-scaling in DynamoDB, you set the minimum and maximum levels of read and write capacity in addition to the target utilization percentage. Auto-scaling uses Amazon CloudWatch to monitor a table’s read and write capacity metrics. To do so, it creates CloudWatch alarms that track consumed capacity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon DynamoDB table with a global secondary index</strong> - A global secondary index (GSI) is an index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the base table. A global secondary index is considered \"global\" because queries on the index can span all of the data in the base table, across all partitions. A global secondary index is stored in its own partition space away from the base table and scales separately from the base table. GSI cannot be used to handle an unpredictable load on a DynamoDB table.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon DynamoDB global table in the provisioned capacity mode</strong> - Global tables build on the global Amazon DynamoDB footprint to provide you with a fully managed, multi-Region, and multi-active database that delivers fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications. Global tables replicate your DynamoDB tables automatically across your choice of AWS Regions.</p>\n\n<p>Global tables eliminate the difficult work of replicating data between Regions and resolving update conflicts, enabling you to focus on your application's business logic. In addition, global tables enable your applications to stay highly available even in the unlikely event of isolation or degradation of an entire Region.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon DynamoDB global tables:\n<img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q62-i2.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/\">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/</a></p>\n\n<p>Amazon DynamoDB global table cannot be used to handle an unpredictable load on a Amazon DynamoDB table.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SecondaryIndexes.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SecondaryIndexes.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-dynamodb-auto-scaling-performance-and-cost-optimization-at-any-scale/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-dynamodb-auto-scaling-performance-and-cost-optimization-at-any-scale/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/\">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/</a></p>\n",

To get started, you create an origin group with two origins: a primary and a secondary. If the primary origin is unavailable or returns specific HTTP response status codes that indicate a failure, CloudFront automatically switches to the secondary origin.</p>\n\n<p>To set up origin failover, you must have a distribution with at least two origins. Next, you create an origin group for your distribution that includes two origins, setting one as the primary.

This encryption ensures that only applications that need the data—and have the credentials to decrypt it—are able to do so.</p>\n\n<p>To use field-level encryption, when you configure your Amazon CloudFront distribution, specify the set of fields in POST requests that you want to be encrypted, and the public key to use to encrypt them.

Geo restriction is not used to configure Amazon CloudFront for high availability and failover.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon CloudFront can route to multiple origins based on the price class</strong> - Amazon CloudFront edge locations are grouped into geographic regions, and AWS has grouped regions into price classes.

The object may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. By default, when Amazon S3 Replication is enabled and an object is deleted in the source bucket, Amazon S3 adds a delete marker in the source bucket only. This action protects data from malicious deletions. If you have delete marker replication enabled, these markers are copied to the destination buckets, and Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted in both source and destination buckets. However, someone with administrative access to Amazon S3 can disable cross-Region replication and then delete all versions from both source as well as the destination, so this option will not be able to safeguard your data compared to Amazon S3 Object Lock.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Activate AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) delete on the Amazon S3 bucket</strong> - When working with Amazon S3 Versioning in Amazon S3 buckets, you can optionally add another layer of security by configuring a bucket to enable MFA (multi-factor authentication) delete. When you do this, the bucket owner must include two forms of authentication in any request to delete a version or change the versioning state of the bucket. Only the root account can enable MFA delete.
